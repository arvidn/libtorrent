	* improved the piece picker performance and made it possible to download
	  popular pieces in sequence to improve disk performance.
	* added the possibility to control upload and download limits per peer.
	* fixed problem with re-requesting skipped pieces when peer was sending pieces
	  out of fifo-order.
	* added support for http seeding (the GetRight protocol)
	* renamed identifiers called 'id' in the public interface to support linking
	  with Objective.C++
	* changed the extensions protocol to use the new one, which is also
	  implemented by uTorrent.
	* factorized the peer_connection and added web_peer_connection which is
	  able to download from http-sources. (currently only for single file torrents).
	* converted the network code to use asio
	* made libtorrent build in vc7 (patches from Allen Zhao)
	* fixed bug caused when binding outgoing connections to a non-local interface.
	* add_torrent() will now throw if called while the session object is
	  being closed.
	* added the ability to limit the number of simultaneous half-open
	  TCP connections. Flags in peer_info has been added.

release 0.9.1

	* made the session disable file name checks within the boost.filsystem library
	* fixed race condition in the sockets
	* strings that are invalid utf-8 strings are now decoded with the
	  local codepage on windows
	* added the ability to build libtorrent both as a shared library
	* client_test can now monitor a directory for torrent files and automatically
	  start and stop downloads while running
	* fixed problem with file_size() when building on windows with unicode support
	* added a new torrent state, allocating
	* added a new alert, metadata_failed_alert
	* changed the interface to session::add_torrent for some speed optimizations.
	* greatly improved the command line control of the example client_test.
	* fixed bug where upload rate limit was not being applied.
	* files that are being checked will no longer stall files that don't need
	  checking.
	* changed the way libtorrent identifies support for its excentions
	  to look for 'ext' at the end of the peer-id.
	* improved performance by adding a circle buffer for the send buffer.
	* fixed bugs in the http tracker connection when using an http proxy.
	* fixed problem with storage's file pool when creating torrents and then
	  starting to seed them.
	* hard limit on remote request queue and timeout on requests (a timeout
	  triggers rerequests). This makes libtorrent work much better with
	  "broken" clients like BitComet which may ignore requests.
