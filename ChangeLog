	* added an extension to the DHT network protocol to support the
	  exchange of nodes with IPv6 addresses.
	* modified the ip_filter api slightly to support IPv6
	* modified the api slightly to make sequenced download threshold
	  a per torrent-setting.
	* changed the address type to support IPv6
	* fixed bug in piece picker which would not behave as
	  expected with regard to sequenced download threshold.
	* fixed bug with file_progress() with files > 2 GB.
	* added --enable-examples option to configure script.
	* fixed problem with the resource distribution algorithm
	  (controlling e.g upload/download rates).
	* fixed incorrect asserts in storage related to torrents with
	  zero-sized files.
	* added support for trackerless torrents (with kademlia DHT).
	* support for torrents with the private flag set.
	* support for torrents containing bootstrap nodes for the
	  DHT network.
	* fixed problem with the configure script on FreeBSD.
	* limits the pipelining used on url-seeds.
	* fixed problem where the shutdown always would delay for
	  session_settings::stop_tracker_timeout seconds.
	* session::listen_on() won't reopen the socket in case the port and
	  interface is the same as the one currently in use.
	* added http proxy support for web seeds.
	* fixed problem where upload and download stats could become incorrect
	  in case of high cpu load.
	* added more clients to the identifiable list.
	* fixed fingerprint parser to cope with latest Mainline versions.

release 0.10

	* fixed a bug where the requested number of peers in a tracker request could
	  be too big.
	* fixed a bug where empty files were not created in full allocation mode.
	* fixed a bug in storage that would, in rare cases, fail to do a
	  complete check.
	* exposed more settings for tweaking parameters in the piece-picker,
	  downloader and uploader (http_settings replaced by session_settings).
	* tweaked default settings to improve high bandwidth transfers.
	* improved the piece picker performance and made it possible to download
	  popular pieces in sequence to improve disk performance.
	* added the possibility to control upload and download limits per peer.
	* fixed problem with re-requesting skipped pieces when peer was sending pieces
	  out of fifo-order.
	* added support for http seeding (the GetRight protocol)
	* renamed identifiers called 'id' in the public interface to support linking
	  with Objective.C++
	* changed the extensions protocol to use the new one, which is also
	  implemented by uTorrent.
	* factorized the peer_connection and added web_peer_connection which is
	  able to download from http-sources.
	* converted the network code to use asio (resulted in slight api changes
	  dealing with network addresses).
	* made libtorrent build in vc7 (patches from Allen Zhao)
	* fixed bug caused when binding outgoing connections to a non-local interface.
	* add_torrent() will now throw if called while the session object is
	  being closed.
	* added the ability to limit the number of simultaneous half-open
	  TCP connections. Flags in peer_info has been added.

release 0.9.1

	* made the session disable file name checks within the boost.filsystem library
	* fixed race condition in the sockets
	* strings that are invalid utf-8 strings are now decoded with the
	  local codepage on windows
	* added the ability to build libtorrent both as a shared library
	* client_test can now monitor a directory for torrent files and automatically
	  start and stop downloads while running
	* fixed problem with file_size() when building on windows with unicode support
	* added a new torrent state, allocating
	* added a new alert, metadata_failed_alert
	* changed the interface to session::add_torrent for some speed optimizations.
	* greatly improved the command line control of the example client_test.
	* fixed bug where upload rate limit was not being applied.
	* files that are being checked will no longer stall files that don't need
	  checking.
	* changed the way libtorrent identifies support for its excentions
	  to look for 'ext' at the end of the peer-id.
	* improved performance by adding a circle buffer for the send buffer.
	* fixed bugs in the http tracker connection when using an http proxy.
	* fixed problem with storage's file pool when creating torrents and then
	  starting to seed them.
	* hard limit on remote request queue and timeout on requests (a timeout
	  triggers rerequests). This makes libtorrent work much better with
	  "broken" clients like BitComet which may ignore requests.

	* serves multiple torrents on a single port and a single thread
	* supports http proxies and proxy authentication
