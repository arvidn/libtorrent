introduction
------------

A tracker with the protocol "udp://" in its URI
is supposed to be contacted using this protocol.

This protocol is supported by
xbt-tracker_.


.. _xbt-tracker: http://xbtt.sourceforge.net

For additional information and descriptions of
the terminology used in this document, see
the `protocol specification`__

__ http://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification

All values are sent in network byte order (big-endian). The sizes
are specified with ANSI-C standard types.

If no response to a request is received within 15 seconds, resend
the request. If no reply has been received after 60 seconds, stop
retrying.


connecting
----------

Client sends packet:

|             |                     | in network byte order. This will       |
|             |                     | identify the protocol.                 |

Server replies with packet:

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int64_t     | connection_id       | A connection id, this is used when     |

|             |                     | the tracker, to identify you.          |
|             |                     | This connection id can be reused for   |
|             |                     | multiple requests, but if it's cached  |
|             |                     | for too long, it will not be valid     |
|             |                     | anymore.                               |

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

The rest of the server reply is a variable number of the following structure:

| int32_t     | transaction_id      | Randomized by client.                  |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

The following structure is repeated for each info-hash to scrape, but limited by
the MTU.

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int32_t     | transaction_id      | Must match the sent transaction id.    |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

The rest of the packet contains the following structures once for each info-hash
you asked in the scrape request.

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+


errors
------

In case of a tracker error,

server replies packet:

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| size        | name                | description                            |
+=============+=====================+========================================+
| int32_t     | action              | The action, in this case 3, for error. |
|             |                     | See actions_.                          |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int32_t     | transaction_id      | Must match the transaction_id sent     |
|             |                     | from the client.                       |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int8_t[]    | error_string        | The rest of the packet is a string     |
|             |                     | describing the error.                  |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+


actions
-------

The action fields has the following encoding:

	* connect = 0
	* announce = 1
	* scrape = 2
	* error = 3 (only in server replies)


extensions
----------

The extensions field is a bitmask. The following
bits are assigned:

	* 1 = authentication_.
	* 2 = `request string`_.

If multiple bits are present in the extension field, the extension
bodies are appended to the packet in the order of least significant
bit first. For instance, if both bit 1 and 2 are set, the extension
represented by bit 1 comes first, followed by the extension represented
by bit 2.

authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The packet will have an authentication part
appended to it. It has the following format:

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| size        | name                | description                            |
+=============+=====================+========================================+
| int8_t      | username_length     | The number of characters in the        |
|             |                     | username.                              |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int8_t[]    | username            | The username, the number of characters |
|             |                     | as specified in the previous field.    |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| uint8_t[8]  | passwd_hash         | sha1(packet + sha1(password))          |
|             |                     | The packet in this case means the      |
|             |                     | entire packet except these 8 bytes     |
|             |                     | that are the password hash. These are  |
|             |                     | the 8 first bytes (most significant)   |
|             |                     | from the 20 bytes hash calculated.     |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

request string
--------------

The request string extension is meant to allow torrent creators pass along
cookies back to the tracker. This can be useful for authenticating that a
torrent is allowed to be tracked by a tracker for instance. It could also
be used to authenticate users by generating torrents with unique tokens
in the tracker URL for each user. The extension body has the following format:

+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| size        | name                | description                            |
+=============+=====================+========================================+
| int8_t      | request length      | The number of bytes in the request     |
|             |                     | string.                                |
+-------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| int8_t[]    | request string      | The string that comes after the host-  |
|             |                     | name and port in the UDP tracker URL.  |
|             |                     | Typically this starts with "/announce" |
|             |                     | The bittorrent client is not expected  |
|             |                     | to append query string arguments for   |
|             |                     | stats reporting, like "uploaded" and   |
|             |                     | "downloaded" since this is already     |
|             |                     | reported in the UDP tracker protocol.  |
|             |                     | However, the client is free to add     |
|             |                     | arguments as extensions.               |
