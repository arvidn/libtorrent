libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
other bittorrent implementations around. It is a
library and not a full featured client, although it comes with a working
example client.

The main goals of libtorrent are:

	* to be cpu efficient
	* to be memory efficient
	* to be very easy to use

See docs/manual.html for more detailed build and usage instructions.

To build with autotools, run:

   ./configure

Followed by

   make

When libtorrent is built, finish off by running the tests:

   make check
