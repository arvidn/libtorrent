<title>Various Artists - netBloc Vol. 36_ Get Dusted _Illness From The Dusted Wax Stacks_</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1902-various-artists---netbloc-vol-36_-get-dusted-_illness-from-the-dusted-wax-stacks_</link>
<description>Can you believe that we're approaching our fifth year of bringing you only the best music from netlabel and netaudio culture?!? It's been an amazing five years and I thank you for continuing to listen. Over the years, blocSonic has become more than a tastemaker. We've grown and expanded into releasing our own quality releases. However we grow and develop in the future, our commitment to continued support of netaudio via our netBloc series is stronger than ever. With this, our 36th volume in the series, we're committing to one annual year-end netBloc that shines the spotlight on ONE netlabel. This year we're bringing you a collection of fire from the extensive Dusted Wax Kingdom archives! Over the years of bringing you these netBlocs, there are a few netlabels who have become staples of the compilation series. More recently, DWK has become one of these favorites. Though, their catalog is extensive enough that many gems just haven't received the shine they deserve. So here you have a collection of 15 tracks that present to you a good representation of the Dusted Wax Kingdom sound. Thanks to label head Dimitar for making the experience of compiling this collection a great one! Thanks to all artists of the DWK roster for doing what you do and sharing your art with the world. You all &amp; everyone in the netaudio culture make music intriguing again.Thanks again to our listeners! Remember... everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music moving... share it... blog it... podcast it! If you're in radio... support independent music and broadcast it! HAPPY NEW YEAR! Be safe.</description>

<title>1in10 Varia - A Million Ways</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1901-1in10-varia---a-million-ways</link>
<description>New album mashup album by one member of Varia, you might remember them from their previous release at Enough Records, a double album titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://enoughrecords.scene.org/?cat=enrmp269&quot;&gt;Magic + Omega&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite hard to define their style in writing, a remix / mashup sonic soup of sorts using 70s and 80s classics in post new wave / disco / electro fashion mixed with some occasional movie or audiobook sampling.</description>

<title>Alister Flint Discography</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1898-alister-flint-discography</link>
<description>[SLNT033] Alister Flint - Under The Surface[SLNT027] Alister Flint - Alter Nativis[SLNT015] Alister Flint - UchuuBought his first &quot;synth&quot; in the mid-90s, a Yamaha PSR500 (r), which was more an arranger rather than really a synthetiser, Alister stepped into the world of eletronic music after having been heavily influenced by key albums such as Tangerine Dream's Stratosfear or Rubycon, as well as having performed as a techno DJ in free parties in southern France. Late 90s, he bought his first computer equiped with a 16bit soundcard and started to track his first electronic tunes on Fast Tracker (r), which is more like programming rather than any real play, using all kinds of codes to iunput notes, effects and such. But most of his production at time was techno/trance oriented.Shortly after 2000, the release of a revolutionary daw, Reason (r), opened a much wider scope of genres and styles, and he started to produce more downtempo, chilled out, groove-based pieces. And it was also the birth of his very humble home studio, with a Yamaha P-80 (r) piano, and a semi-pro Creamware (r) soundcard. With the additions of congas, derbekehh, and more recently, Korg nanoSeries as portable studio, he started to produce and perform live some experimental and ambient pieces.He has done a few collaborations with musicians such as C. Vaisvil in various genres, and he's now actively part of a newly born musician community, Not Only Music, opened to all kinds of genres, and artforms, with an expanding interest for microtonal music.'Uchuu' [SLNT015] is the first release of Alister Flint.</description>

<title>All The Empires Of The World - Return</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1872-all-the-empires-of-the-world---return</link>
<description>All the Empires of the World return with a work of staggering ambition and scope. Taking their familiar desert-doom vibe and supplementing it with some furious chug, a drum machine borrowed from Streetcleaner-era Godflesh and blackened vocals, Return oscillates between extremes of tenderness and brutality. It's the mark of a band supremely confident in their abilities who remain eager to stake out new territory.With an atmosphere of surreal violence that flirts with the sublime it brings to mind the films of Jodorowsky and the darker moments of Iain M. Banks' novels, whilst musical comparisons can be drawn with Cult of Luna, Grails, Pelican and - in its quieter moments - Six Organs of Admittance. We know of few bands who push at generic conventions so compellingly and are overwhelmingly proud to be releasing this to the world.Must be listened to loud.</description>

<title>090 - Pie Are Squared - Hungover in Siberia</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1871-090---pie-are-squared---hungover-in-siberia</link>
<description>(Hungover in) Siberia is Pie Are Squared's third release and the first part of an ongoing trilogy; a venturesomely bold series of interrelated recordings. (Hungover in) Siberia plays as one long-form composition that is constructed with deliberate melodrama to pay homage to a plethora of human emotions, partly inspired by the seemingly infinite Siberian landscapes. Autobiographical in nature, the music expresses the protagonist's loneliness and longing to rejuvenate his soul and assuage his mind, and his journey through his own personal looking-glass into a hallucinatory world.download in .flac and other formats at http://piearesquared.bandcamp.com/album/hungover-in-siberiahttp://lostchildrennetlabel.com</description>

<title>The Picture of Dorian Gray  by  Oscar Wilde - A Librivox Audio Book</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1869-the-picture-of-dorian-gray-by-oscar-wilde---a-librivox-audio-book</link>
<description>The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Basil is impressed by Dorian's beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses his desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than himself. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, plunging him into debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging. This reading uses the 20-chapter 1891 version of Wilde's novel. (Summary by Wikipedia)

<title>Peace On Earth, Good-Will To Dogs  by Eleanor Hallowell Abbott  - A Librivox Audio Book</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1868-peace-on-earth-good-will-to-dogs-by-eleanor-hallowell-abbott---a-librivox-audio-book</link>
<description>&quot;If you don't like Christmas stories, don't read this one!

And if you don't like dogs I don't know just what to advise you to do!

For I warn you perfectly frankly that I am distinctly pro-dog and distinctly pro-Christmas, and would like to bring to this little story whatever whiff of fir-balsam I can cajole from the make-believe forest in my typewriter, and every glitter of tinsel, smudge of toy candle, crackle of wrapping paper, that my particular brand of brain and ink can conjure up on a single keyboard! And very large-sized dogs shall romp through every page! And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero! And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you'd just about given up hope! And all the heart of the story is very,-oh very young!

<title>Pathagar - SheevaPlug edition v0.01</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1865-pathagar---sheevaplug-edition-v001</link>
<description>

This image is a ready-to-go image that can be bitcopied using dd to a 2GB or greater USB stick, and plugged into a off-the-shelf SheevaPlug to run a Pathagar Book Server. &lt;/p&gt;

dd if=pathagar-sheevaplug-0.01.img of=/dev/sdb &lt;/p&gt;

where sdb is your USB Stick. This process will create a boot partition, a root partition and a swap partition on the USB Stick.&lt;/p&gt;

The image is a Debian Squeeze image for ARM with Apache, sqlite, python, and python-django (Pathagar is written atop python-django). The image has two accounts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; root (password is password. Change it ASAP!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  bookserver (password is password. Change it ASAP!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Pathagar runs in the bookserver account and the code sits at /home/bookserver/pathagar. The code we've used for this iteration is git'able from https://github.com/manuq/pathagar&lt;/p&gt;

The image runs a dhcp client, so you'll have to get clever to figure out the IP it gets from your DHCP server. Once running, you can find the book server interface at &lt;youripaddress&gt; running at port 80. To administer Pathagar, go to &lt;youripaddress&gt;/admin and use the account &quot;curator&quot; with password &quot;password&quot; (change it ASAP!) to administer the account.&lt;/youripaddress&gt;&lt;/youripaddress&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Tone_-_Small_Arm_of_Sea_International_edition_2009_PonyRec-Uhrlaut_mp3_album_electronica_alternative</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1864-tone_-_small_arm_of_sea_international_edition_2009_ponyrec-uhrlaut_mp3_album_electronica_alternative</link>
<description>With her abstract beats, unique voice and hypnotizing lyrics, the female singer, musician and producer Tone is renowned for her both forceful and frail expressions in experimental electronica.On her debut album she shows her great versatility ranging from uplifting vigorous outlets of energy to obscure, melancholic moods. An album released in a new audiovisual format - with an invitation to copy and share freely at no charge!Musically, Tone creates a remarkable audiovisual realm where her light and spellbinding voice adds to a bedrock of crunchy break beats, abstract compositional structures and catchy melodies. Not being a typical songwriter in terms of clinging to the usage of the traditionalstructure of verses and choruses, Tone relies on improvisation and creative exploration in the creation of her unpredictable musical landscapes - while adding daunting, yet compelling lyrics - and thereby drawing listeners into her musical and atmospheric universe of thoughts, sounds and a myriad of emotional expressions.This is the international version of the album, released by PonyRec in 2009.The original album (same content) was released by Uhrlaut/Urlyd Records in 2008.</description>

<title>Kiloton_-_Language_Lost_2010_Uhrlaut_mp3_album_electronica_alternative</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1863-kiloton_-_language_lost_2010_uhrlaut_mp3_album_electronica_alternative</link>
<description>In a small apartment on the northern shores of Denmark sits electronica-artist Kiloton. Surrounded by computers, sound modules and various electronics he concentrated leans over a small short wave receiver.Distorted fractions of radio signals and static from all over the globe resonate into the room from the little box and mix with deep electronic reverberations from Kiloton's own sound systems. A sound with distinct reference to the instrumental dub-music of Jamaica, but in a more brisk Scandinavian version, which in interplay with the crackling sound fragments from the radio receiver creates an emotional expression that communicates without words. An almost lost language - which is now released as an album.For over two years Kiloton have elegantly recorded, edited, manipulated, distorted and modulated the crackling - and globally originating - short wave sound samples to form pieces in the complex, melodic and challenging puzzle that is his musical creativity. Having produced and performed for several years as well as contributed to several releases both domestically and abroad, Kiloton aka. Mads Weitling has now finally releases his solo-debut 'Language Lost', which hit the street on Friday, August 27 2010.An abstract, wordless and dark, yet dreamy album that carries a distinct nordic tone. Characterized by sharp, abrupt rhythms under deep, smouldering and crackling dubscapes, Kiloton has developed an almost cinematic sound that leads its listener through changing moods; beatiful and sincere as well as melancholic and thoughtful.</description>

<title>A Thousand Bayonets</title>
<link>http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1860-a-thousand-bayonets</link>
<description>Upon returning from Afghanistan, journalist John Webster discovers a gang war in his backyard. Now he must find a way to survive in this Canadian warzone-or die in the crossfire. John Webster has seen the terrible things human beings can do. He's an experienced investigative journalist, recently returned from the war in Afghanistan. John saw hell over there; he looked death straight in the face. He is glad to be back to the normalcy of his Canadian home-that is, until he realizes there is a war brewing in his own backyard, and &quot;peace&quot; is a word no longer spoken. John gets caught up in the battle between two of the most powerful and murderous criminal gangs in the city. Using what he learned on the foreign battlefields, he stays alive, despite the price on his head. The only way to save his own life is to find the man responsible for the brutal neighborhood bloodshed. When the police slap a subpoena on him, though, John finds his only solace on the streets. Suddenly, John is back in a warzone, fighting for his life. Will he be able to stop the bloodthirsty crime lords? The flashbacks to Afghanistan threaten to pull John into darkness. Soon, the past and present collide, and he can't tell which way is up or down. The need for redemption may be stronger than the need for survival as John Webster finds himself on his most dangerous assignment yet. Visit www.joelmarkharris.com for more details. </description>
