puff.c is a simple inflate written to be an unambiguous way to specify the
deflate format.  It is not written for speed but rather simplicity.  As a
side benefit, this code might actually be useful when small code is more
important than speed, such as bootstrap applications.  For typical deflate
data, zlib's inflate() is about four times as fast as puff().  zlib's
inflate compiles to around 20K on my machine, whereas puff.c compiles to
around 4K on my machine (a PowerPC using GNU cc).  If the faster decode()
function here is used, then puff() is only twice as slow as zlib's
inflate().

All dynamically allocated memory comes from the stack.  The stack required
is less than 2K bytes.  This code is compatible with 16-bit int's and
assumes that long's are at least 32 bits.  puff.c uses the short data type,
assumed to be 16 bits, for arrays in order to to conserve memory.  The code
works whether integers are stored big endian or little endian.

In the comments below are "Format notes" that describe the inflate process
and document some of the less obvious aspects of the format.  This source
code is meant to supplement RFC 1951, which formally describes the deflate
format:
