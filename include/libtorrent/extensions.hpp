// OVERVIEW
//
// libtorrent has a plugin interface for implementing extensions to the protocol.
// These can be general extensions for transferring metadata or peer exchange
// extensions, or it could be used to provide a way to customize the protocol
// to fit a particular (closed) network.
//
// In short, the plugin interface makes it possible to:
//
// * register extension messages (sent in the extension handshake), see
//   extensions_.
// * add data and parse data from the extension handshake.
// * send extension messages and standard bittorrent messages.
// * override or block the handling of standard bittorrent messages.
// * save and restore state via the session state
// * see all alerts that are posted
//
// a word of caution
// -----------------
//
// Writing your own plugin is a very easy way to introduce serious bugs such as
// dead locks and race conditions. Since a plugin has access to internal
// structures it is also quite easy to sabotage libtorrent's operation.
//
// All the callbacks are always called from the libtorrent network thread. In
// case portions of your plugin are called from other threads, typically the main
// thread, you cannot use any of the member functions on the internal structures
// in libtorrent, since those require being called from the libtorrent network
// thread . Furthermore, you also need to synchronize your own shared data
// within the plugin, to make sure it is not accessed at the same time from the
// libtorrent thread (through a callback). If you need to send out a message
// from another thread, it is advised to use an internal queue, and do the
// actual sending in ``tick()``.
//
// Since the plugin interface gives you easy access to internal structures, it
// is not supported as a stable API. Plugins should be considered specific to a
// specific version of libtorrent. Although, in practice the internals mostly
// don't change that dramatically.
//
//
// plugin-interface
// ----------------
//
// The plugin interface consists of three base classes that the plugin may
// implement. These are called plugin, torrent_plugin and peer_plugin.
// They are found in the ``<libtorrent/extensions.hpp>`` header.
//
// These plugins are instantiated for each session, torrent and possibly each peer,
// respectively.
//
// For plugins that only need per torrent state, it is enough to only implement
// ``torrent_plugin`` and pass a constructor function or function object to
// ``session::add_extension()`` or ``torrent_handle::add_extension()`` (if the
// torrent has already been started and you want to hook in the extension at
// run-time).
//
// The signature of the function is:
//
// .. code:: c++
//
// 	std::shared_ptr<torrent_plugin> (*)(torrent_handle const&, client_data_t);
//
// The second argument is the userdata passed to ``session::add_torrent()`` or
// ``torrent_handle::add_extension()``.
//
// The function should return a ``std::shared_ptr<torrent_plugin>`` which
// may or may not be 0. If it is a nullptr, the extension is simply ignored
// for this torrent. If it is a valid pointer (to a class inheriting
// ``torrent_plugin``), it will be associated with this torrent and callbacks
// will be made on torrent events.
//
// For more elaborate plugins which require session wide state, you would
// implement ``plugin``, construct an object (in a ``std::shared_ptr``) and pass
// it in to ``session::add_extension()``.
//
// custom alerts
// -------------
//
// Since plugins are running within internal libtorrent threads, one convenient
// way to communicate with the client is to post custom alerts.
//
// The expected interface of any alert, apart from deriving from the alert
// base class, looks like this:
//
// .. parsed-literal::
//
// 	static const int alert_type = *<unique alert ID>*;
// 	virtual int type() const { return alert_type; }
//
// 	virtual std::string message() const;
//
// 	static const alert_category_t static_category = *<bitmask of alert::category_t flags>*;
// 	virtual alert_category_t category() const { return static_category; }
//
// 	virtual char const* what() const { return *<string literal of the name of this alert>*; }
//
// The ``alert_type`` is used for the type-checking in ``alert_cast``. It must
// not collide with any other alert. The built-in alerts in libtorrent will
// not use alert type IDs greater than ``user_alert_id``. When defining your
// own alert, make sure it's greater than this constant.
//
// ``type()`` is the run-time equivalence of the ``alert_type``.
//
// The ``message()`` virtual function is expected to construct a useful
// string representation of the alert and the event or data it represents.
// Something convenient to put in a log file for instance.
//
// ``clone()`` is used internally to copy alerts. The suggested implementation
// of simply allocating a new instance as a copy of ``*this`` is all that's
// expected.
//
// The static category is required for checking whether or not the category
// for a specific alert is enabled or not, without instantiating the alert.
// The ``category`` virtual function is the run-time equivalence.
//
// The ``what()`` virtual function may simply be a string literal of the class
// name of your alert.
//
// For more information, see the `alert section`_.
//
// .. _`alert section`: reference-Alerts.html
