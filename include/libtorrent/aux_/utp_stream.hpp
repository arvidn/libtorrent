// since the uTP socket state may be needed after the
// utp_stream is closed, it's kept in a separate struct
// whose lifetime is not tied to the lifetime of utp_stream

// the utp socket is closely modelled after the asio async
// operations and handler model. For writing to the socket,
// the client provides a list of buffers (for gather/writev
// style of I/O) and whenever the socket can write another
// packet to the stream, it picks up data from these buffers.
// When all of the data has been written, or enough time has
// passed since we first started writing, the write handler
// is called and the write buffer is reset. This means that
// we're not writing anything at all while waiting for the
// client to re-issue a write request.

// reading is a little bit more complicated, since we must
// be able to receive data even when the user doesn't have
// an outstanding read operation on the socket. When the user
// does however, we want to receive data directly into the
// user's buffer instead of first copying it into our receive
// buffer. This is why the receive case is more complicated.
// There are two receive buffers. One provided by the user,
// which when present is always used. The other one is used
// when the user doesn't have an outstanding read request,
// and hence hasn't provided any buffer space to receive into.

// the user provided read buffer is called "m_read_buffer" and
// its size is "m_read_buffer_size". The buffer we spill over
// into when the user provided buffer is full or when there
// is none, is "m_receive_buffer" and "m_receive_buffer_size"
// respectively.

// in order to know when to trigger the read and write handlers
// there are two counters, m_read and m_written, which count
// the number of bytes we've stuffed into the user provided
// read buffer or written to the stream from the write buffer.
// These are used to trigger the handlers if we're written a
// large number of bytes. It's also triggered if we're filled
// the whole read buffer, or written the entire write buffer.
// The last way the handlers can be triggered is if we're read
// or written some, and enough time has elapsed since then.

// when we receive data into m_receive_buffer (i.e. the buffer
// used when there's no user provided one) is stored as a
// number of heap allocated packets. This is just because it's
// simple to reuse the data structured and it provides all the
// functionality needed for this buffer.
