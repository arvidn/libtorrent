// OVERVIEW
//
// This section describes the functions and classes that are used
// to create torrent files. It is a layered API with low level classes
// and higher level convenience functions. A torrent is created in 4
// steps:
//
// 1. first the files that will be part of the torrent are determined.
// 2. the torrent properties are set, such as tracker url, web seeds,
//    DHT nodes etc.
// 3. Read through all the files in the torrent, SHA-1 all the data
//    and set the piece hashes.
// 4. The torrent is bencoded into a file or buffer.
//
// If there are a lot of files and or deep directory hierarchies to
// traverse, step one can be time consuming.
//
// Typically step 3 is by far the most time consuming step, since it
// requires to read all the bytes from all the files in the torrent.
//
// All of these classes and functions are declared by including
// ``libtorrent/create_torrent.hpp``.
//
// example:
//
// .. code:: c++
//
//	file_storage fs;
//
//	// recursively adds files in directories
//	add_files(fs, "./my_torrent");
//
//	create_torrent t(fs);
//	t.add_tracker("http://my.tracker.com/announce");
//	t.set_creator("libtorrent example");
//
//	// reads the files and calculates the hashes
//	set_piece_hashes(t, ".");
//
//	ofstream out("my_torrent.torrent", std::ios_base::binary);
//	std::vector<char> buf = t.generate_buf();
//	out.write(buf.data(), buf.size());
//
//	// alternatively, generate an entry and encode it directly to an ostream
//	// iterator
//	bencode(std::ostream_iterator<char>(out), t.generate());
//
