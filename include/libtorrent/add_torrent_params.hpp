	// The add_torrent_params is a parameter pack for adding torrents to a
	// session. The key fields when adding a torrent are:
	//
	// * ti - when you have loaded a .torrent file into a torrent_info object
	// * info_hash - when you don't have the metadata (.torrent file) but. This
	//   is set when adding a magnet link.
	//
	// one of those fields must be set. Another mandatory field is
	// ``save_path``. The add_torrent_params object is passed into one of the
	// ``session::add_torrent()`` overloads or ``session::async_add_torrent()``.
	//
	// If you only specify the info-hash, the torrent file will be downloaded
	// from peers, which requires them to support the metadata extension. For
	// the metadata extension to work, libtorrent must be built with extensions
	// enabled (``TORRENT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS`` must not be defined). It also
	// takes an optional ``name`` argument. This may be left empty in case no
	// name should be assigned to the torrent. In case it's not, the name is
	// used for the torrent as long as it doesn't have metadata. See
	// ``torrent_handle::name``.
	//
	// The ``add_torrent_params`` is also used when requesting resume data for a
	// torrent. It can be saved to and restored from a file and added back to a
	// new session. For serialization and deserialization of
	// ``add_torrent_params`` objects, see read_resume_data() and
