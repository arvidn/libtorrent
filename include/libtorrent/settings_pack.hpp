// OVERVIEW
//
// You have some control over session configuration through the session::apply_settings()
// member function. To change one or more configuration options, create a settings_pack
// object and fill it with the settings to be set and pass it in to session::apply_settings().
//
// The settings_pack object is a collection of settings updates that are applied
// to the session when passed to session::apply_settings(). It's empty when
// constructed.
//
// You have control over proxy and authorization settings and also the user-agent
// that will be sent to the tracker. The user-agent will also be used to identify the
// client with other peers.
//
// Each configuration option is named with an enum value inside the
// settings_pack class. These are the available settings:

			//
			// A list of names will be used to bind outgoing TCP sockets in a
			// round-robin fashion. An IP address will simply be used to `bind()`
			// the socket. An interface name will attempt to bind the socket to
			// that interface. If that fails, or is unsupported, one of the IP
			// addresses configured for that interface is used to `bind()` the

			// associated NIC/Adapter.

			// will be rejected with a peer_blocked_alert with

			//
			// It is possible to listen on multiple interfaces and
			// multiple ports. Binding to port 0 will make the operating system
			// pick the port.
			//
			// .. note::
			//    There are reasons to stick to the same port across sessions,
			//    which would mean only using port 0 on the first start, and

			//    Trackers, the DHT and other peers will remember the port they see
			//    you use and hand that port out to other peers trying to connect
			//    to you, as well as trying to connect to you themselves.
			//
			// A port that has an "s" suffix will accept SSL peer connections. (note
			// that SSL sockets are only available in builds with SSL support)
			//
			// A port that has an "l" suffix will be considered a local network.
			// i.e. it's assumed to only be able to reach hosts in the same local
			// network as the IP address (based on the netmask associated with the
			// IP, queried from the operating system).
			//
			// if binding fails, the listen_failed_alert is posted. Once a
			// socket binding succeeds (if it does), the listen_succeeded_alert
			// is posted. There may be multiple failures before a success.
			//
			// If a device name that does not exist is configured, no listen
			// socket will be opened for that interface. If this is the only
			// interface configured, it will be as if no listen ports are
			// configured.
			//
			// If no listen ports are configured (e.g. listen_interfaces is an
			// empty string), networking will be disabled. No DHT will start, no
			// outgoing uTP or tracker connections will be made. No incoming TCP
			// or uTP connections will be accepted. (outgoing TCP connections
			// will still be possible, depending on
			// settings_pack::outgoing_interfaces).
			//

			// ``[::1]:8888`` - will only accept connections on the IPv6 loopback

			//
			// ``eth0:4444,eth1:4444`` - will accept connections on port 4444 on
			// any IP address bound to device ``eth0`` or ``eth1``.
			//
			// ``[::]:0s`` - will accept SSL connections on a port chosen by the
			// OS. And not accept non-SSL connections at all.
			//
			// ``0.0.0.0:6881,[::]:6881`` - binds to all interfaces on port 6881.
			//
			// ``10.0.1.13:6881l`` - binds to the local IP address, port 6881, but
			// only allow talking to peers on the same local network. The netmask
			// is queried from the operating system. Interfaces marked ``l`` are
