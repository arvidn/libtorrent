// 
// You have some control over session configuration through the session::apply_settings()
// member function. To change one or more configuration options, create a settings_pack
// object and fill it with the settings to be set and pass it in to session::apply_settings().
// 
// The settings_pack object is a collection of settings updates that are applied
// to the session when passed to session::apply_settings(). It's empty when
// constructed.
// 
// You have control over proxy and authorization settings and also the user-agent
// that will be sent to the tracker. The user-agent will also be used to identify the
// client with other peers.
