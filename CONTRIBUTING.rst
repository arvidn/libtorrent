bug reporting checklist
.......................

Please keep in mind that there are 2 different ways of building
libtorrent (boost-build and cmake). There are also a number of build
time configuration options (``TORRENT_*`` macros). If it may be relevant, please
include how libtorrent was built in your bug report.

boost-build is the preferred build system and the root ``Makefile`` is the
 package tool. If there's a problem with a build script, please
consider posting a pull request with a fix.

Please be explicit about the behavior you see, ideally boil it down to its
essentials and provide example code, calling into libtorrent, reproducing the
problem.

For bittorrent protocol level issues, please include session, torrent and peer
level logs. Logs are enabled in the ``alert_mask``.

For tracker issues, please include a wireshark dump of the tracker announce
and response. It may be useful to also include session and torrent logs.

pull request checklist
......................

When creating a pull request, please consider the following checklist:

* make sure both travis-CI and appveyor builds are green. Note that on gcc and
  clang warnings are treated as errors. Some tests may be flapping, if so,
  please issue a rebuild of the specific build configuration. (I'm working on
  making all tests deterministic)
* please make sure to add appropriate comments. For client-facing changes,
  update the documentation comments in the public header (accepts restructured
  text)
* If adding a client-facing feature, please add brief entry to ``ChangeLog``
* Add a unit test (``tests``) or a regression test (``simulations``) to confirm
  the new behavior or feature. Don't forget negative tests (failure cases) and
  please pay as much care to tests as you would production code.
* if your patch adds a new file, please make sure it's added to
  the ``Jamfile``, ``Makefile`` and ``CMakeList.txt``.
