<p>
libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
<a href="links.html">other bittorrent implementations</a> around. It is a
library and not a full featured client, although it comes with a working
example client.
</p>

<p>
The main goals of libtorrent are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>to be cpu efficient
	<li>to be memory efficient
	<li>to be very easy to use
</ul>

<p>
libtorrent is not finished. It is an ongoing project (including this documentation).
The current state includes the following features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>multitracker extension support
	(as <a href="http://home.elp.rr.com/tur/multitracker-spec.txt">described by TheShadow</a>)
	<li>serves multiple torrents on a single port and a single thread
	<li>supports http proxies and proxy authentication
	<li>gzipped tracker-responses
	<li>piece picking on block-level (as opposed to piece-level) like in
	<a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a>
	<li>queues torrents for file check, instead of checking all of them in parallel.
	<li>uses separate threads for checking files and for main downloader, with a fool-proof
	thread-safe library interface. (i.e. There's no way for the user to cause a deadlock).
</ul>

<p>
Functions that are yet to be implemented:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>optimistic unchoke
	<li>upload speed cap
	<li>Snubbing
	<li>end game mode
	<li>new allocation model
	<li>fast resume
	<li>file-level piece priority
</ul>

<p>
libtorrent is portable at least among windows, macosx, and UNIX-systems. It uses boost.thread,
boost.filesystem and various other boost libraries and zlib.
</p>

<p>
libtorrent has been successfully compiled and tested on:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cygwin GCC 3.3.1
	<li>Windows 2000 vc7.1
	<li>Linux x86 (debian) GCC 3.0
</ul>

<h1>building</h1>

<p>
To build libtorrent you need <a href="http://www.boost.org">boost</a> and bjam installed.
Then you can use <tt>bjam</tt> to build libtorrent.
</p>

<p>
To make bjam work, you need to set the environment variable <tt>BOOST_ROOT</tt> to the
path where boost is installed (e.g. c:\boost_1_30_2 on windows). Then you can just run
<tt>bjam</tt> in the libtorrent directory.
</p>

<p>
The Jamfile doesn't work yet. On unix-systems you can use the makefile however. You
first have to build boost.thread and boost.filesystem. You do this by, in the directory
'boost-1.30.2/tools/build/jam_src' run the build script <tt>./build.sh</tt>. This should
produce at least one folder with the 'bin' prefix (and the rest of the name describes
your platform). Put the files in that folder somewhere in your path.
</p>

<p>
You can then invoke <tt>bjam</tt> in the directories 'boost-1.30.2/libs/thread/build' and
'boost-1.30.2/libs/filesystem/build'. That will produce the needed libraries. Put these
libraries in the libtorrent root directory. You then have to modify the makefile to use
you prefered compiler and to have the correct path to your boost istallation.
</p>

<p>
Then the makefile should be able to do the rest.
</p>

<p>
When building (with boost 1.30.2) on linux and solaris however, I found that I had to make the following
modifications to the boost.date-time library. In the file:
'boost-1.30.2/boost/date_time/gregorian_calendar.hpp' line 59. Prepend 'boost/date_time/'
to the include path.
</p>

<p>And the second modification was in the file:
'boost-1.30.2/boost/date_time/microsec_time_clock.hpp' add the following include at the top
of the file:
</p>

<code>#include "boost/cstdint.hpp"</code>

<p>
TODO: more detailed build instructions.
</p>

<h1>using</h1>

<p>
The interface of libtorrent consists of a few classes. The main class is
the <tt>session</tt>, it contains the main loop that serves all torrents.
</p>

<h2>session</h2>

<p>
The <tt>session</tt> class has the following synopsis:
</p>

<pre>
class session: public boost::noncopyable
{
	session(int listen_port, const std::string&amp; fingerprint = std::string());

	torrent_handle add_torrent(const torrent_info&amp; t, const std::string&amp; save_path);

	void set_http_settings(const http_settings&amp; settings);
};
</pre>

<p>
Once it's created, it will spawn the main thread that will do all the work.
The main thread will be idle as long it doesn't have any torrents to participate in.
You add torrents through the <tt>add_torrent()</tt>-function where you give an
object representing the information found in the torrent file and the path where you
want to save the files. The <tt>save_path</tt> will be prepended to the directory-
structure in the torrent-file.
</p>

<p>
If the torrent you are trying to add already exists in the session (is either queued
for checking, being checked or downloading) <tt>add_torrent()</tt> will throw
<tt>duplicate_torrent</tt> which derives from <tt>std::exception</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>fingerprint</tt> is a short string that will be used in the peer_id to
identify the client. If the string is longer than 7 characters it will
be trimmed down to 7 characters. The default is an empty string.
</p>

<p>
How to parse a torrent file and create a <tt>torrent_info</tt> object is described below.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#torrent_handle"><tt>torrent_handle</tt></a> returned by <tt>add_torrent</tt>
can be used to retrieve information about the torrent's progress, its peers etc. It
is also used to abort a torrent.
</p>

<p>
The constructor takes a listen port as argument, if the given port is busy it will
increase the port number by one and try again. If it still fails it will continue
increasing the port number until it succeeds or has failed 9 ports. <i>This will
change in the future to give more control of the listen-port.</i>
</p>

<h2>parsing torrent files</h2>

<p>
The torrent files are <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/protocol.html">
bencoded</a>. There are two functions in libtorrent that can encode and decode
bencoded data. They are:
</p>

<h3>
template&lt;class InIt&gt;
entry bdecode(InIt start, InIt end);<br>

template&lt;class OutIt&gt;
void bencode(OutIt out, const entry&amp; e);
</h3>

<p>
The <tt>entry</tt> class is the internal representation of the bencoded data
and it can be used to retreive information, an entry can also be build by
the program and given to <tt>bencode()</tt> to encode it into the <tt>OutIt</tt>
iterator.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>OutIt</tt> and <tt>InIt</tt> are iterators
(<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html"><tt>InputIterator</tt></a>
and <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/OutputIterator.html"><tt>OutputIterator</tt></a>
respectively). They are templates and are usually instantiated as
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/ostream_iterator.html">
<tt>std::ostream_iterator</tt></a>,
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/back_insert_iterator.html">
<tt>std::back_insert_iterator</tt></a> or
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/istream_iterator.html">
<tt>std::istream_iterator</tt></a>. These functions will assume that the iterator
refers to a character (<tt>char</tt>). So, if you want to encode entry <tt>e</tt>
into a buffer in memory, you can do it like this:
</p>

<code>std::vector&lt;char&gt; buffer;
bencode(std::back_insert_iterator&lt;std::vector&lt;char&gt; &gt;(buf), e);
</code>

<p>
If you want to decode a torrent file from a buffer in memory, you can do it like this:
</p>

<code>std::vector&lt;char&gt; buffer;

// ...

entry e = bdecode(buf.begin(), buf.end());
</code>

<p>
Or, if you have a raw char buffer:
</p>

<code>const char* buf;

// ...

entry e = bdecode(buf, buf + data_size);
</code>

<p>
Now we just need to know how to retrieve information from the <tt>entry</tt>.
</p>

<h2>entry</h2>

<p>
The <tt>entry</tt> class represents one node in a bencoded hierarchy. It works as a
variant type, it can be either a list, a dictionary (<tt>std::map</tt>), an integer
or a string. This is its synopsis:
</p>

<pre>
class entry
{
public:

	typedef std::map&lt;std::string, entry&gt; dictionary_type;
	typedef std::string string_type;
	typedef std::vector&lt;entry&gt; list_type;
	typedef <i>implementation-defined</i> integer_type;

	enum data_type
	{
		int_t,
		string_t,
		list_t,
		dictionary_t,
		undefined_t
	};

	data_type type() const;

	entry();
	entry(data_type t);
	entry(const entry&amp; e);

	void operator=(const entry&amp; e);

	integer_type&amp; integer()
	const integer_type&amp; integer() const;
	string_type&amp; string();
	const string_type&amp; string() const;
	list_type&amp; list();
	const list_type&amp; list() const;
	dictionary_type&amp; dict();
	const dictionary_type&amp; dict() const;

	void print(std::ostream&amp; os, int indent = 0) const;
};
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>integer()</tt>, <tt>string()</tt>, <tt>list()</tt> and <tt>dict()</tt> functions
are accessorts that return the respecive type. If the <tt>entry</tt> object isn't of the
type you request, the accessor will throw <tt>type_error</tt> (which derives from
<tt>std::runtime_error</tt>). You can ask an <tt>entry</tt> for its type through the
<tt>type()</tt> function.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>print()</tt> function is there for debug purposes only.
</p>

<p>
If you want to create an <tt>entry</tt> you give it the type you want it to have in its
constructor, and then use one of the non-const accessors to get a reference which you then
can assign the value you want it to have.
</p>

<p>
The typical code to get info from a torrent file will then look like this:
</p>

<code>entry torrent_file;

// ...

const entry::dictionary_type&amp; dict = torrent_file.dict();
entry::dictionary_type::const_iterator i;
i = dict.find("announce");
if (i != dict.end())
{
	std::string tracker_url= i-&gt;second.string();
	std::cout &lt;&lt; tracker_url &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code>

<p>
To make it easier to extract information from a torren file, the class <tt>torrent_info</tt>
exists.
</p>

<h2>torrent_info</h2>
<p>
The <tt>torrent_info</tt> has the following synopsis:
</p>

<pre>
class torrent_info
{
public:

	torrent_info(const entry&amp; torrent_file)

	typedef std::vector&lt;file&gt;::const_iterator file_iterator;
	typedef std::vector&lt;file&gt;::const_reverse_iterator reverse_file_iterator;

	file_iterator begin_files() const;
	file_iterator end_files() const;
	reverse_file_iterator rbegin_files() const;
	reverse_file_iterator rend_files() const;

	std::size_t num_files() const;
	const file&amp; file_at(int index) const;

	const std::vector&lt;announce_entry&gt;&amp; trackers() const;

	int prioritize_tracker(int index);

	entry::integer_type total_size() const;
	entry::integer_type piece_length() const;
	std::size_t num_pieces() const;
	const sha1_hash&amp; info_hash() const;
	const std::stirng&amp; name() const;

	void print(std::ostream&amp; os) const;

	entry::integer_type piece_size(unsigned int index) const;
	const sha1_hash&amp; hash_for_piece(unsigned int index) const;
};
</pre>

<p>
This class will need some explanation. First of all, to get a list of all files
in the torrent, you can use <tt>begin_files()</tt>, <tt>end_files()</tt>,
<tt>rbegin_files()</tt> and <tt>rend_files()</tt>. These will give you standard vector
iterators with the type <tt>file</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
struct file
{
	std::string path;
	std::string filename;
	entry::integer_type size;
};
</pre>

<p>
If you need index-access to files you can use the <tt>num_files()</tt> and <tt>file_at()
</tt> to access files using indices.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>print()</tt> function is there for debug purposes only. It will print the info from
the torrent file to the given outstream.
</p>

<p>
<tt>name()</tt> returns the name of the torrent.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>trackers()</tt> function will return a sorted vector of <tt>announce_entry</tt>.
Each announce entry contains a string, which is the tracker url, and a tier index. The
tier index is the high-level priority. No matter which trackers that works or not, the
ones with lower tier will always be tried before the one with higher tier number.
</p>

<pre>
struct announce_entry
{
	std::string url;
	int tier;
};
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>prioritize_tracker()</tt> is used internally to move a tracker to the front
of its tier group. i.e. It will never be moved pass a tracker with a different tier
number. For more information about how multiple trackers are dealt with, see the
<a href="http://home.elp.rr.com/tur/multitracker-spec.txt">specification</a>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>total_size()</tt>, <tt>piece_length()</tt> and <tt>num_pieces()</tt> returns the total
number of bytes the torrent-file represents (all the files in it), the number of byte for
each piece and the total number of pieces, respectively. The difference between
<tt>piece_size()</tt> and <tt>piece_length()</tt> is that <tt>piece_size()</tt> takes
the piece index as argument and gives you the exact size of that piece. It will always
be the same as <tt>piece_length()</tt> except in the case of the last piece, which may
be smaller.
</p>

<p>
<tt>hash_for_piece()</tt> takes a piece-index and returns the 20-bytes sha1-hash for that
piece and <tt>info_hash()</tt> returns the 20-bytes sha1-hash for the info-section of the
torrent file. For more information on the <tt>sha1_hash</tt>, see the <a href="#big_number">big_number</a> class.
</p>

<h2><a name="torrent_handle"></a>torrent_handle</h2>

<p>
You will usually have to store your <tt>torrent_handle</tt>s somewhere, since it's the
object through which you retrieve infromation about the torrent and aborts the torrent.
Its declaration looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
struct torrent_handle
{
	torrent_handle();
	void abort();

	torrent_status status() const;
	void get_download_queue(std::vector&lt;partial_piece_info&gt;&amp; queue);
	void get_peer_info(std::vector&lt;peer_info&gt;&amp; v);
};
</pre>

<p>
The default constructor will initialize the handle to an invalid state. Which means you cannot
perform any operation on it, unless you first assign it a valid handle. If you try to perform
any operation they will simply return.
</p>


<p>
<tt>abort()</tt> will close all peer connections associated with this torrent and tell
the tracker that we've stopped participating in the swarm. This handle will become invalid
shortly after this call has been made.
</p>

<h3>status()</h3>

<p>
<tt>status()</tt> will return a structure with information about the status of this
torrent. It contains the following fields:
</p>

<pre>
struct torrent_status
{
	enum state_t
	{
		invalid_handle,
		queued_for_checking,
		checking_files,
		downloading,
		seeding
	};
	
	state_t state;
	float progress;
	boost::posix_time::time_duration next_announce;
	std::size_t total_download;
	std::size_t total_upload;
};
</pre>

<p>
<tt>progress</tt> is a value in the range [0, 1], that represents the progress of the
torrent's current task. It may be checking files or downloading. The torrent's
current task is in the <tt>state</tt> member, it will be one of the following:
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<tt>invalid_handle</tt>
		</td>
		<td>
			This will be the state if you called status on an uninitialized handle (a
			handle that was constructed with the default constructor).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<tt>queued_for_checking</tt>
		</td>
		<td>
			The torrent is in the queue for being checked. But there currently is another
			torrent that are being checked. This torrent will wait for its turn.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<tt>checking_files</tt>
		</td>
		<td>
			The torrent has not started its download yet, and is currently checking existing
			files.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<tt>downloading</tt>
		</td>
		<td>
			The torrent is being downloaded. This is the state most torrents will be in most
			of the time. The progress meter will tell how much of the files that has been
			downloaded.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<tt>seeding</tt>
		</td>
		<td>
			In this state the torrent has finished downloading and is a pure seeder.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
<tt>next_announce</tt> is the time until the torrent will announce itself to the tracker.
</p>

<p>
<tt>total_download</tt> and <tt>total_upload</tt> is the number of bytes downloaded and
uploaded to all peers, accumulated.
</p>

<h3>get_download_queue()</h3>

<p>
<tt>get_download_queue()</tt> takes a non-const reference to a vector which it will fill
information about pieces that are partially downloaded or not downloaded at all but partially
requested. The entry in the vector (<tt>partial_piece_info</tt>) looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
struct partial_piece_info
{
	enum { max_blocks_per_piece = <i>implementation-defined</i> };
	int piece_index;
	int blocks_in_piece;
	std::bitset&lt;max_blocks_per_piece&gt; requested_blocks;
	std::bitset&lt;max_blocks_per_piece&gt; finished_blocks;
	peer_id peer[max_blocks_per_piece];
	int num_downloads[max_blocks_per_piece];
};
</pre>

<p>
<tt>piece_index</tt> is the index of the piece in question. <tt>blocks_in_piece</tt> is the
number of blocks in this particular piece. This number will be the same for most pieces, but
the last piece may have fewer blocks than the standard pieces.
</p>

<p>
<tt>requested_blocks</tt> is a bitset with one bit per block in the piece. If a bit is set, it
means that that block has been requested, but not necessarily fully downloaded yet. To know
from whom the block has been requested, have a look in the <tt>peer</tt> array. The bit-index
in the <tt>requested_blocks</tt> and <tt>finished_blocks</tt> correspons to the array-index into
<tt>peers</tt> and <tt>num_downloads</tt>. The array of peers is contains the id of the
peer the piece was requested from. If a piece hasn't been requested (the bit in
<tt>requested_blocks</tt> is not set) the peer array entry will be undefined.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>finished_blocks</tt> is a bitset where each bit says if the block is fully downloaded
or not. And the <tt>num_downloads</tt> array says how many times that block has been downloaded.
When a piece fails a hash verification, single blocks may be redownloaded to see if the hash teast
may pass then.
</p>

<h3>get_peer_info()</h3>

<p>
<tt>get_peer_info()</tt> takes a reference to a vector that will be cleared and filled
with one entry for each peer connected to this torrent. Each entry contains information about
that particular peer. It contains the following information:
</p>

<pre>
struct peer_info
{
	enum
	{
		interesting = 0x1,
		choked = 0x2,
		remote_interested = 0x4,
		remote_choked = 0x8
	};
	unsigned int flags;
	address ip;
	float up_speed;
	float down_speed;
	unsigned int total_download;
	unsigned int total_upload;
	peer_id id;
	std::vector&lt;bool&gt; pieces;
};
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> attribute tells you in which state the peer is. It is set to
any combination of the four enums above. Where <tt>interesting</tt> means that we
are interested in pieces from this peer. <tt>choked</tt> means that <u>we</u> have
choked this peer. <tt>remote_interested</tt> and <tt>remote_choked</tt> means the
same thing but that the peer is interested in pieces from us and the peer has choked
<u>us</u>.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>ip</tt> field is the IP-address to this peer. Its type is a wrapper around the
actual address and the port number. See <a href"#address">address</a> class.
</p>

<p>
<tt>up_speed</tt> and <tt>down_speed</tt> is the current upload and download speed
we have to and from this peer. These figures are updated aproximately once every second.
</p>

<p>
<tt>total_download</tt> and <tt>total_upload</tt> are the total number of bytes downloaded
from and uploaded to this peer. These numbers do not include the protocol chatter, but only
the payload data.
</p>

<p>
<tt>id</tt> is the peer's id as used in the bit torrent protocol. This id can be used to
extract 'fingerprints' from the peer. Sometimes it can tell you which client the peer
is using.
</p>

<p>
<tt>pieces</tt> is a vector of booleans that has as many entries as there are pieces
in the torrent. Each boolean tells you if the peer has that piece (if it's set to true)
or if the peer miss that piece (set to false).
</p>

<p>
TODO: address
</p>

<h2>http_settings</h2>

<p>
You have some control over tracker requests through the <tt>http_settings</tt> object. You
create it and fill it with your settings and the use <tt>session::set_http_settings()</tt>
to apply them. You have control over proxy and authorization settings and also the user-agent
that will be sent to the tracker. The user-agent is a good way to identify your client.
</p>

<pre>
struct http_settings
{
	http_settings();
	std::string proxy_ip;
	int proxy_port;
	std::string proxy_login;
	std::string proxy_password;
	std::string user_agent;
	int tracker_timeout;
	int tracker_maximum_response_length;
};
</pre>

<p>
<tt>tracker_timeout</tt> is the number of seconds the tracker connection will
wait until it considers the tracker to have timed-out. Default value is 30
seconds.
</p>

<p>
<tt>tracker_maximum_response_length</tt> is the maximum number of bytes in a
tracker response. If a response size passes this number it will be rejected
and the connection will be closed. On gzipped responses this size is measured
on the uncompressed data. So, if you get 20 bytes of gzip response that'll
expand to 2 megs, it will be interrupted before the entire response has been
uncompressed (given your limit is lower than 2 megs). Default limit is
1 megabyte.
</p>

<h2><a name="big_number"></a>big_number</h2>

<p>
Both the <tt>peer_id</tt> and <tt>sha1_hash</tt> types are typedefs of the class
<tt>big_number</tt>. It represents 20 bytes of data. Its synopsis follows:
</p>

<pre>
class big_number
{
public:
	bool operator==(const big_number&amp; n) const;
	bool operator!=(const big_number&amp; n) const;
	bool operator&lt;(const big_number&amp; n) const;

	const unsigned char* begin() const;
	const unsigned char* end() const;

	unsigned char* begin();
	unsigned char* end();
};
</pre>

<p>
The iterators gives you access to individual bytes.
</p>

<h2>hasher</h2>

<p>
This class creates sha1-hashes. Its declaration looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
class hasher
{
public:
	hasher();

	void update(const char* data, unsigned int len);
	sha1_hash final();
	void reset();
};
</pre>

<p>
You use it by first instantiating it, then call <tt>update()</tt> to feed it
with data. i.e. you don't have to keep the entire buffer of which you want to
create the hash in memory. You can feed the hasher parts of it at a time. When
You have fed the hasher with all the data, you call <tt>final()</tt> and it
will return the sha1-hash of the data.
</p>

<p>
If you want to reuse the hasher object once you have created a hash, you have to
call <tt>reset()</tt> to reinitialize it.
</p>

<p>
The sha1-algorithm used was implemented by Steve Reid and released as public domain.
For more info, see <tt>src/sha1.c</tt>.
