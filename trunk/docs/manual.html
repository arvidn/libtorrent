<p>The interface of libtorrent consists of a few classes. The main class is
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session</span></tt>, it contains the main loop that serves all torrents.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="things-to-keep-in-mind">
<h1>things to keep in mind</h1>
<p>A common problem developers are facing is torrents stopping without explanation.
Here is a description on which conditions libtorrent will stop your torrents,
how to find out about it and what to do about it.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep track of the paused state, the error state and the upload
mode of your torrents. By default, torrents are auto-managed, which means
libtorrent will pause them, unpause them, scrape them and take them out
of upload-mode automatically.</p>
<p>Whenever a torrent encounters a fatal error, it will be stopped, and the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_status::error</span></tt> will describe the error that caused it. If a torrent
is auto managed, it is scraped periodically and paused or resumed based on
the number of downloaders per seed. This will effectively seed torrents that
are in the greatest need of seeds.</p>
<p>If a torrent hits a disk write error, it will be put into upload mode. This
means it will not download anything, but only upload. The assumption is that
the write error is caused by a full disk or write permission errors. If the
torrent is auto-managed, it will periodically be taken out of the upload
mode, trying to write things to the disk again. This means torrent will recover
from certain disk errors if the problem is resolved. If the torrent is not
auto managed, you have to call <a class="reference internal" href="#set-upload-mode">set_upload_mode()</a> to turn
downloading back on again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network-primitives">
<h1>network primitives</h1>
<p>There are a few typedefs in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libtorrent</span></tt> namespace which pulls
in network types from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">asio</span></tt> namespace. These are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef asio::ip::address address;
typedef asio::ip::address_v4 address_v4;
typedef asio::ip::address_v6 address_v6;
using asio::ip::tcp;
using asio::ip::udp;
</pre>
<p>These are declared in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;libtorrent/socket.hpp&gt;</span></tt> header.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">using</span></tt> statements will give easy access to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tcp::endpoint
udp::endpoint
</pre>
<p>Which are the endpoint types used in libtorrent. An endpoint is an address
with an associated port.</p>
<p>For documentation on these types, please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="http://asio.sourceforge.net/asio-0.3.8/doc/asio/reference.html">asio documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If the fingerprint in the first overload is omited, the client will get a default
fingerprint stating the version of libtorrent. The fingerprint is a short string that will be
used in the peer-id to identify the client and the client's version. For more details see the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fingerprint">fingerprint</a> class. The constructor that only takes a fingerprint will not open a
listen port for the session, to get it running you'll have to call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::listen_on()</span></tt>.
The other constructor, that takes a port range and an interface as well as the fingerprint
will automatically try to listen on a port on the given interface. For more information about
the parameters, see <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt> function.</p>
<p>The flags paramater can be used to start default features (upnp &amp; nat-pmp) and default plugins
(ut_metadata, ut_pex and smart_ban). The default is to start those things. If you do not want
them to start, pass 0 as the flags parameter.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alert_mask</span></tt> is the same mask that you would send to <a class="reference internal" href="#set-alert-mask">set_alert_mask()</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>~session()</h2>
<p>The destructor of session will notify all trackers that our torrents have been shut down.
If some trackers are down, they will time out. All this before the destructor of session
returns. So, it's advised that any kind of interface (such as windows) are closed before
destructing the session object. Because it can take a few second for it to finish. The
timeout can be set with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set_settings()</span></tt>.</p>

<p>loads and saves all session settings, including dht_settings, encryption settings and proxy
settings. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_state</span></tt> writes all keys to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">entry</span></tt> that's passed in, which needs to
either not be initialized, or initialized as a dictionary.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_state</span></tt> expects a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lazy_entry</span></tt> which can be built from a bencoded buffer with
<a class="reference internal" href="#lazy-bdecode">lazy_bdecode()</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flags</span></tt> arguments passed in to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_state</span></tt> can be used to filter which parts
of the session state to save. By default, all state is saved (except for the individual
torrents). These are the possible flags. A flag that's set, means those settings are saved:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

        save_settings =     0x001,
        save_dht_settings = 0x002,

<p>Pausing the session has the same effect as pausing every torrent in it, except that
torrents will not be resumed by the auto-manage mechanism. Resuming will restore the
torrents to their previous paused state. i.e. the session pause state is separate from
the torrent pause state. A torrent is inactive if it is paused or if the session is
paused.</p>

<p>In case you want to destruct the session asynchrounously, you can request a session
destruction proxy. If you don't do this, the destructor of the session object will
block while the trackers are contacted. If you keep one <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_proxy</span></tt> to the
session when destructing it, the destructor will not block, but start to close down
the session, the destructor of the proxy will then synchronize the threads. So, the
destruction of the session is performed from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session</span></tt> destructor call until the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_proxy</span></tt> destructor call. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_proxy</span></tt> does not have any operations
on it (since the session is being closed down, no operations are allowed on it). The
only valid operation is calling the destructor:</p>

<p>You add torrents through the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent()</span></tt> function where you give an
object with all the parameters. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent()</span></tt> overloads will block
until the torrent has been added (or failed to be added) and returns an
error code and a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_handle</span></tt>. In order to add torrents more efficiently,
consider using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async_add_torrent()</span></tt> which returns immediately, without
waiting for the torrent to add. Notification of the torrent being added is sent
as <a class="reference internal" href="#add-torrent-alert">add_torrent_alert</a>.</p>
<p>The overload that does not take an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_code</span></tt> throws an exception on
error and is not available when building without exception support.</p>
<p>The only mandatory parameters are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_path</span></tt> which is the directory where you
want the files to be saved. You also need to specify either the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ti</span></tt> (the
torrent file), the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info_hash</span></tt> (the info hash of the torrent) or the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></tt>
(the URL to where to download the .torrent file from). If you specify the
info-hash, the torrent file will be downloaded from peers, which requires them to
support the metadata extension. For the metadata extension to work, libtorrent must
be built with extensions enabled (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TORRENT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS</span></tt> must not be
defined). It also takes an optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></tt> argument. This may be left empty in case no
name should be assigned to the torrent. In case it's not, the name is used for
the torrent as long as it doesn't have metadata. See <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_handle::name</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If the torrent doesn't have a tracker, but relies on the DHT to find peers, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trackers</span></tt> (or the deprecated <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tracker_url</span></tt>) can specify tracker urls that
for the torrent.</p>
<p>If you specify a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></tt>, the torrent will be set in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloading_metadata</span></tt> state
until the .torrent file has been downloaded. If there's any error while downloading,
the torrent will be stopped and the torrent error state (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_status::error</span></tt>)
will indicate what went wrong. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></tt> may refer to a magnet link or a regular
http URL.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dht_nodes</span></tt> is a list of hostname and port pairs, representing DHT nodes to be
added to the session (if DHT is enabled). The hostname may be an IP address.</p>
<p>If the torrent you are trying to add already exists in the session (is either queued
for checking, being checked or downloading) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent()</span></tt> will throw
<a class="reference internal" href="#libtorrent-exception">libtorrent_exception</a> which derives from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::exception</span></tt> unless <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">duplicate_is_error</span></tt>
is set to false. In that case, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent</span></tt> will return the handle to the existing
torrent.</p>
<p>The optional parameter, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resume_data</span></tt> can be given if up to date fast-resume data
is available. The fast-resume data can be acquired from a running torrent by calling
<a class="reference internal" href="#save-resume-data">save_resume_data()</a> on <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-handle">torrent_handle</a>. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fast-resume">fast resume</a>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vector</span></tt> that is
passed in will be swapped into the running torrent instance with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::vector::swap()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_mode</span></tt> parameter refers to the layout of the storage for this torrent.
There are 3 different modes:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>storage_mode_sparse</dt>
<dd>All pieces will be written to the place where they belong and sparse files
will be used. This is the recommended, and default mode.</dd>
<dt>storage_mode_allocate</dt>
<dd>All pieces will be written to their final position, all files will be
allocated in full when the torrent is first started. This is done with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fallocate()</span></tt> and similar calls. This mode minimizes fragmentation.</dd>
<dt>storage_mode_compact</dt>
<dd><strong>this mode is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of libtorrent</strong>
The storage will grow as more pieces are downloaded, and pieces
are rearranged to finally be in their correct places once the entire torrent has been
downloaded.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For more information, see <a class="reference internal" href="#storage-allocation">storage allocation</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage</span></tt> can be used to customize how the data is stored. The default
storage will simply write the data to the files it belongs to, but it could be
overridden to save everything to a single file at a specific location or encrypt the
content on disk for instance. For more information about the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_interface</span></tt>
that needs to be implemented for a custom storage, see <a class="reference internal" href="#storage-interface">storage_interface</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">userdata</span></tt> parameter is optional and will be passed on to the extension
constructor functions, if any (see <a class="reference internal" href="#add-extension">add_extension()</a>).</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-handle">torrent_handle</a> returned by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent()</span></tt> can be used to retrieve information
about the torrent's progress, its peers etc. It is also used to abort a torrent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file_priorities</span></tt> can be set to control the initial file priorities when adding
a torrent. The semantics are the same as for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_handle::prioritize_files()</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">version</span></tt> is filled in by the constructor and should be left untouched. It
is used for forward binary compatibility.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trackerid</span></tt> is the default tracker id to be used when announcing to trackers. By default
this is empty, and no tracker ID is used, since this is an optional argument. If
a tracker returns a tracker ID, that ID is used instead of this.</p>
<p>if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">uuid</span></tt> is specified, it is used to find duplicates. If another torrent is already
running with the same UUID as the one being added, it will be considered a duplicate. This
is mainly useful for RSS feed items which has UUIDs specified.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source_feed_url</span></tt> should point to the URL of the RSS feed this torrent comes from,
if it comes from an RSS feed.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flags</span></tt> is a 64 bit integer used for flags controlling aspects of this torrent
and how it's added. These are the flags:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
enum flags_t
{
        flag_seed_mode = 0x001,
        flag_override_resume_data = 0x002,
        flag_upload_mode = 0x004,
        flag_share_mode = 0x008,
        flag_apply_ip_filter = 0x010,
        flag_paused = 0x020,
        flag_auto_managed = 0x040.
        flag_duplicate_is_error = 0x080,
        flag_merge_resume_trackers = 0x100,
        flag_update_subscribe = 0x200
}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_apply_ip_filter</span></tt> determines if the IP filter should apply to this torrent or not. By
default all torrents are subject to filtering by the IP filter (i.e. this flag is set by
default). This is useful if certain torrents needs to be excempt for some reason, being
an auto-update torrent for instance.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_merge_resume_trackers</span></tt> defaults to off and specifies whether tracker URLs loaded from
resume data should be added to the trackers in the torrent or replace the trackers.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_update_subscribe</span></tt> is on by default and means that this torrent will be part of state
updates when calling <a class="reference internal" href="#post-torrent-updates">post_torrent_updates()</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_paused</span></tt> specifies whether or not the torrent is to be started in a paused
state. I.e. it won't connect to the tracker or any of the peers until it's
resumed. This is typically a good way of avoiding race conditions when setting
configuration options on torrents before starting them.</p>
<p>If you pass in resume data, the paused state of the torrent when the resume data
was saved will override the paused state you pass in here. You can override this
by setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_override_resume_data</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_auto_managed</span></tt> is set, the torrent will be queued, started and seeded
automatically by libtorrent. When this is set, the torrent should also be started
as paused. The default queue order is the order the torrents were added. They
are all downloaded in that order. For more details, see <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a>.</p>
<p>If you pass in resume data, the auto_managed state of the torrent when the resume data
was saved will override the auto_managed state you pass in here. You can override this
by setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">override_resume_data</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_seed_mode</span></tt> is set, libtorrent will assume that all files are present
for this torrent and that they all match the hashes in the torrent file. Each time
a peer requests to download a block, the piece is verified against the hash, unless
it has been verified already. If a hash fails, the torrent will automatically leave
the seed mode and recheck all the files. The use case for this mode is if a torrent
is created and seeded, or if the user already know that the files are complete, this
is a way to avoid the initial file checks, and significantly reduce the startup time.</p>
<p>Setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_seed_mode</span></tt> on a torrent without metadata (a .torrent file) is a no-op
and will be ignored.</p>
<p>If resume data is passed in with this torrent, the seed mode saved in there will
override the seed mode you set here.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_override_resume_data</span></tt> is set, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paused</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_managed</span></tt>
state of the torrent are not loaded from the resume data, but the states requested
by the flags in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_torrent_params</span></tt> will override them.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_upload_mode</span></tt> is set, the torrent will be initialized in upload-mode,
which means it will not make any piece requests. This state is typically entered
on disk I/O errors, and if the torrent is also auto managed, it will be taken out
of this state periodically. This mode can be used to avoid race conditions when
adjusting priorities of pieces before allowing the torrent to start downloading.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag_share_mode</span></tt> determines if the torrent should be added in <em>share mode</em> or not.
Share mode indicates that we are not interested in downloading the torrent, but
merlely want to improve our share ratio (i.e. increase it). A torrent started in
share mode will do its best to never download more than it uploads to the swarm.
If the swarm does not have enough demand for upload capacity, the torrent will
not download anything. This mode is intended to be safe to add any number of torrents
to, without manual screening, without the risk of downloading more than is uploaded.</p>
<p>A torrent in share mode sets the priority to all pieces to 0, except for the pieces
that are downloaded, when pieces are decided to be downloaded. This affects the progress
bar, which might be set to &quot;100% finished&quot; most of the time. Do not change file or piece
priorities for torrents in share mode, it will make it not work.</p>
<p>The share mode has one setting, the share ratio target, see <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::share_mode_target</span></tt>
for more info.</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is_listening()</span></tt> will tell you whether or not the session has successfully
opened a listening port. If it hasn't, this function will return false, and
then you can use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt> to make another attempt.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_port()</span></tt> returns the port we ended up listening on. Since you just pass
a port-range to the constructor and to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt>, to know which port it
ended up using, you have to ask the session using this function.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt> will change the listen port and/or the listen interface. If the
session is already listening on a port, this socket will be closed and a new socket
will be opened with these new settings. The port range is the ports it will try
to listen on, if the first port fails, it will continue trying the next port within
the range and so on. The interface parameter can be left as 0, in that case the
os will decide which interface to listen on, otherwise it should be the ip-address
of the interface you want the listener socket bound to. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt> returns the
error code of the operation in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ec</span></tt>. If this indicates success, the session is
listening on a port within the specified range. If it fails, it will also
generate an appropriate alert (<a class="reference internal" href="#listen-failed-alert">listen_failed_alert</a>).</p>
<p>If all ports in the specified range fails to be opened for listening, libtorrent will
try to use port 0 (which tells the operating system to pick a port that's free). If
that still fails you may see a <a class="reference internal" href="#listen-failed-alert">listen_failed_alert</a> with port 0 even if you didn't
ask to listen on it.</p>
<p>It is possible to prevent libtorrent from binding to port 0 by passing in the flag
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::no_system_port</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flags</span></tt> argument.</p>
<p>The interface parameter can also be a hostname that will resolve to the device you
want to listen on. If you don't specify an interface, libtorrent may attempt to
listen on multiple interfaces (typically 0.0.0.0 and ::). This means that if your
IPv6 interface doesn't work, you may still see a <a class="reference internal" href="#listen-failed-alert">listen_failed_alert</a>, even though
the IPv4 port succeeded.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flags</span></tt> parameter can either be 0 or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::listen_reuse_address</span></tt>, which
will set the reuse address socket option on the listen socket(s). By default, the
listen socket does not use reuse address. If you're running a service that needs
to run on a specific port no matter if it's in use, set this flag.</p>
<p>If you're also starting the DHT, it is a good idea to do that after you've called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt>, since the default listen port for the DHT is the same as the tcp
listen socket. If you start the DHT first, it will assume the tcp port is free and
open the udp socket on that port, then later, when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on()</span></tt> is called, it
may turn out that the tcp port is in use. That results in the DHT and the bittorrent
socket listening on different ports. If the DHT is active when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_on</span></tt> is
called, the udp port will be rebound to the new port, if it was configured to use
the same port as the tcp socket, and if the listen_on call failed to bind to the
same port that the udp uses.</p>
<p>If you want the OS to pick a port for you, pass in 0 as both first and second.</p>
<p>The reason why it's a good idea to run the DHT and the bittorrent socket on the same
port is because that is an assumption that may be used to increase performance. One
way to accelerate the connecting of peers on windows may be to first ping all peers
with a DHT ping packet, and connect to those that responds first. On windows one
can only connect to a few peers at a time because of a built in limitation (in XP
Service pack 2).</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alert()</span></tt> is used to ask the session if any errors or events has occurred. With
<a class="reference internal" href="#set-alert-mask">set_alert_mask()</a> you can filter which alerts to receive through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alert()</span></tt>.
For information about the alert categories, see <a class="reference internal" href="#alerts">alerts</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alerts()</span></tt> pops all pending alerts in a single call. In high performance environments
with a very high alert churn rate, this can save significant amount of time compared to
popping alerts one at a time. Each call requires one round-trip to the network thread. If
alerts are produced in a higher rate than they can be popped (when popped one at a time)
it's easy to get stuck in an infinite loop, trying to drain the alert queue. Popping the entire
queue at once avoids this problem.</p>
<p>However, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alerts</span></tt> function comes with significantly more responsibility. You pass
in an <em>empty</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::dequeue&lt;alert*&gt;</span></tt> to it. If it's not empty, all elements in it will
be deleted and then cleared. All currently pending alerts are returned by being swapped
into the passed in container. The responsibility of deleting the alerts is transferred
to the caller. This means you need to call delete for each item in the returned dequeue.
It's probably a good idea to delete the alerts as you handle them, to save one extra
pass over the dequeue.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can pass in the same container the next time you call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alerts</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wait_for_alert</span></tt> blocks until an alert is available, or for no more than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_wait</span></tt>
time. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wait_for_alert</span></tt> returns because of the time-out, and no alerts are available,
it returns 0. If at least one alert was generated, a pointer to that alert is returned.
The alert is not popped, any subsequent calls to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wait_for_alert</span></tt> will return the
same pointer until the alert is popped by calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_alert</span></tt>. This is useful for
leaving any alert dispatching mechanism independent of this blocking call, the dispatcher
can be called and it can pop the alert independently.</p>
<p>In the python binding, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wait_for_alert</span></tt> takes the number of milliseconds to wait as an integer.</p>

before it is removed from the routing table. If there are known working nodes

this limit is only used to clear out nodes that don't have any node that can
replace them.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_torrents</span></tt> is the total number of torrents to track from the DHT. This

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file_base</span></tt> is the offset in the file where the storage should start. The normal

if the file. In cases where multiple files are mapped into the same file though,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file_base</span></tt> should be set to an offset so that the different regions do

<p>These functions are used to set and get the prioritiy of individual pieces.

levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li>piece is not downloaded at all</li>
<li>normal priority. Download order is dependent on availability</li>

is the number of blocks in a piece.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flags</span></tt> parameter can be used to specify the granularity of the file progress. If

shut down of the torrent in the sense that no downloaded bytes are wasted.</p>

<p>Peers whose Torrent has a higher priority will take precedence when distributing unchoke slots.

<p>Note that by the time you receive the fast resume data, it may already be invalid if the torrent

<p class="last">The resume data contains the modification timestamps for all files. If one file has

to do this is to pause the torrent, which will flush the cache and disconnect all peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is typically a good idea to save resume data whenever a torrent is completed or paused. In those
cases you don't need to pause the torrent or the session, since the torrent will do no more writing
to its files. If you save resume data for torrents when they are paused, you can accelerate the
shutdown process by not saving resume data again for paused torrents. Completed torrents should
have their resume data saved when they complete and on exit, since their statistics might be updated.</p>
<p class="last">In full allocation mode the reume data is never invalidated by subsequent
writes to the files, since pieces won't move around. This means that you don't need to
pause before writing resume data in full or sparse mode. If you don't, however, any data written to
disk after you saved resume data and before the <a class="reference internal" href="#session">session</a> closed is lost.</p>
</div>
<p>It also means that if the resume data is out dated, libtorrent will not re-check the files, but assume
that it is fairly recent. The assumption is that it's better to loose a little bit than to re-check
the entire file.</p>
<p>It is still a good idea to save resume data periodically during download as well as when
closing down.</p>
<p>Example code to pause and save resume data for all torrents and wait for the alerts:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern int outstanding_resume_data; // global counter of outstanding resume data
std::vector&lt;torrent_handle&gt; handles = ses.get_torrents();

This is deliberate, otherwise there is a race condition for torrents that

<p>Returns true if this handle refers to a valid torrent and false if it hasn't been initialized
or if the torrent it refers to has been aborted. Note that a handle may become invalid after
it has been added to the session. Usually this is because the storage for the torrent is
somehow invalid or if the filenames are not allowed (and hence cannot be opened/created) on
your filesystem. If such an error occurs, a <a class="reference internal" href="#file-error-alert">file_error_alert</a> is generated and all handles

<p>For SSL torrents, use this to specify a path to a .pem file to use as this client's certificate.
The certificate must be signed by the certificate in the .torrent file to be valid.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cert</span></tt> is a path to the (signed) certificate in .pem format corresponding to this torrent.</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dh_params</span></tt> is a path to the Diffie-Hellman parameter file, which needs to be in .pem format.
You can generate this file using the openssl command like this:

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">passphrase</span></tt> may be specified if the private key is encrypted and requires a passphrase to
be decrypted.</p>
<p>Note that when a torrent first starts up, and it needs a certificate, it will suspend connecting
to any peers until it has one. It's typically desirable to resume the torrent after setting the
ssl certificate.</p>
<p>If you receive a <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-need-cert-alert">torrent_need_cert_alert</a>, you need to call this to provide a valid cert. If you

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">handle</span></tt> is a handle to the torrent whose status the object represents.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">progress</span></tt> is a value in the range [0, 1], that represents the progress of the
torrent's current task. It may be checking files or downloading.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">progress_ppm</span></tt> reflects the same value as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">progress</span></tt>, but instead in a range
[0, 1000000] (ppm = parts per million). When floating point operations are disabled,
this is the only alternative to the floating point value in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">progress</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The torrent's current task is in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">state</span></tt> member, it will be one of the following:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="31%" />

</table>
<p>When downloading, the progress is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_wanted_done</span></tt> / <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_wanted</span></tt>. This takes
into account files whose priority have been set to 0. They are not considered.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paused</span></tt> is set to true if the torrent is paused and false otherwise. It's only true
if the torrent itself is paused. If the torrent is not running because the session is
paused, this is still false. To know if a torrent is active or not, you need to inspect
both <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_status::paused</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::is_paused()</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_managed</span></tt> is set to true if the torrent is auto managed, i.e. libtorrent is
responsible for determining whether it should be started or queued. For more info
see <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a></p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sequential_download</span></tt> is true when the torrent is in sequential download mode. In
this mode pieces are downloaded in order rather than rarest first.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is_seeding</span></tt> is true if all pieces have been downloaded.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is_finished</span></tt> is true if all pieces that have a priority &gt; 0 are downloaded. There is
only a distinction between finished and seeding if some pieces or files have been
set to priority 0, i.e. are not downloaded.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has_metadata</span></tt> is true if this torrent has metadata (either it was started from a
.torrent file or the metadata has been downloaded). The only scenario where this can be
false is when the torrent was started torrent-less (i.e. with just an info-hash and tracker
ip, a magnet link for instance). Note that if the torrent doesn't have metadata, the member
<a class="reference internal" href="#get-torrent-info">get_torrent_info()</a> will throw.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error</span></tt> may be set to an error message describing why the torrent was paused, in
case it was paused by an error. If the torrent is not paused or if it's paused but
not because of an error, this string is empty.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next_announce</span></tt> is the time until the torrent will announce itself to the tracker. And
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">announce_interval</span></tt> is the time the tracker want us to wait until we announce ourself
again the next time.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">current_tracker</span></tt> is the URL of the last working tracker. If no tracker request has
been successful yet, it's set to an empty string.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_download</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_upload</span></tt> is the number of bytes downloaded and
uploaded to all peers, accumulated, <em>this session</em> only. The session is considered
to restart when a torrent is paused and restarted again. When a torrent is paused,
these counters are reset to 0. If you want complete, persistent, stats, see
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all_time_upload</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all_time_download</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_payload_download</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_payload_upload</span></tt> counts the amount of bytes
send and received this session, but only the actual payload data (i.e the interesting
data), these counters ignore any protocol overhead.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_failed_bytes</span></tt> is the number of bytes that has been downloaded and that
has failed the piece hash test. In other words, this is just how much crap that
has been downloaded.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_redundant_bytes</span></tt> is the number of bytes that has been downloaded even
though that data already was downloaded. The reason for this is that in some
situations the same data can be downloaded by mistake. When libtorrent sends
requests to a peer, and the peer doesn't send a response within a certain
timeout, libtorrent will re-request that block. Another situation when
libtorrent may re-request blocks is when the requests it sends out are not
replied in FIFO-order (it will re-request blocks that are skipped by an out of
order block). This is supposed to be as low as possible.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pieces</span></tt> is the bitmask that represents which pieces we have (set to true) and
the pieces we don't have. It's a pointer and may be set to 0 if the torrent isn't
downloading or seeding.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">verified_pieces</span></tt> is a bitmask representing which pieces has had their hash
checked. This only applies to torrents in <em>seed mode</em>. If the torrent is not
in seed mode, this bitmask may be empty.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_pieces</span></tt> is the number of pieces that has been downloaded. It is equivalent
to: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::accumulate(pieces-&gt;begin(),</span> <span class="pre">pieces-&gt;end())</span></tt>. So you don't have to
count yourself. This can be used to see if anything has updated since last time
if you want to keep a graph of the pieces up to date.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">download_rate</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_rate</span></tt> are the total rates for all peers for this
torrent. These will usually have better precision than summing the rates from
all peers. The rates are given as the number of bytes per second. The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">download_payload_rate</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_payload_rate</span></tt> respectively is the
total transfer rate of payload only, not counting protocol chatter. This might
be slightly smaller than the other rates, but if projected over a long time
(e.g. when calculating ETA:s) the difference may be noticeable.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_peers</span></tt> is the number of peers this torrent currently is connected to.
Peer connections that are in the half-open state (is attempting to connect)
or are queued for later connection attempt do not count. Although they are
visible in the peer list when you call <a class="reference internal" href="#get-peer-info">get_peer_info()</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_complete</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_incomplete</span></tt> are set to -1 if the tracker did not
send any scrape data in its announce reply. This data is optional and may
not be available from all trackers. If these are not -1, they are the total
number of peers that are seeding (complete) and the total number of peers
that are still downloading (incomplete) this torrent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list_seeds</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list_peers</span></tt> are the number of seeds in our peer list
and the total number of peers (including seeds) respectively. We are not
necessarily connected to all the peers in our peer list. This is the number
of peers we know of in total, including banned peers and peers that we have
failed to connect to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connect_candidates</span></tt> is the number of peers in this torrent's peer list
that is a candidate to be connected to. i.e. It has fewer connect attempts
than the max fail count, it is not a seed if we are a seed, it is not banned
etc. If this is 0, it means we don't know of any more peers that we can try.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_done</span></tt> is the total number of bytes of the file(s) that we have. All
this does not necessarily has to be downloaded during this session (that's
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_payload_download</span></tt>).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_wanted_done</span></tt> is the number of bytes we have downloaded, only counting the
pieces that we actually want to download. i.e. excluding any pieces that we have but
have priority 0 (i.e. not wanted).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_wanted</span></tt> is the total number of bytes we want to download. This is also
excluding pieces whose priorities have been set to 0.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_seeds</span></tt> is the number of peers that are seeding that this client is
currently connected to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_full_copies</span></tt> is the number of distributed copies of the torrent.
Note that one copy may be spread out among many peers. It tells how many copies
there are currently of the rarest piece(s) among the peers this client is
connected to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_fraction</span></tt> tells the share of pieces that have more copies than
the rarest piece(s). Divide this number by 1000 to get the fraction.</p>
<p>For example, if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_full_copies</span></tt> is 2 and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distrbuted_fraction</span></tt>
is 500, it means that the rarest pieces have only 2 copies among the peers
this torrent is connected to, and that 50% of all the pieces have more than
two copies.</p>
<p>If we are a seed, the piece picker is deallocated as an optimization, and
piece availability is no longer tracked. In this case the distributed
copies members are set to -1.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_copies</span></tt> is a floating point representation of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_full_copies</span></tt> as the integer part and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">distributed_fraction</span></tt>
/ 1000 as the fraction part. If floating point operations are disabled
this value is always -1.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">block_size</span></tt> is the size of a block, in bytes. A block is a sub piece, it
is the number of bytes that each piece request asks for and the number of
bytes that each bit in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">partial_piece_info</span></tt>'s bitset represents
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#get-download-queue">get_download_queue()</a>). This is typically 16 kB, but it may be
larger if the pieces are larger.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_uploads</span></tt> is the number of unchoked peers in this torrent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_connections</span></tt> is the number of peer connections this torrent has, including
half-open connections that hasn't completed the bittorrent handshake yet. This is
always &gt;= <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_peers</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">uploads_limit</span></tt> is the set limit of upload slots (unchoked peers) for this torrent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connections_limit</span></tt> is the set limit of number of connections for this torrent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_mode</span></tt> is one of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_mode_allocate</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_mode_sparse</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_mode_compact</span></tt>. Identifies which storage mode this torrent is being saved
with. See <a class="reference internal" href="#storage-allocation">Storage allocation</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up_bandwidth_queue</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down_bandwidth_queue</span></tt> are the number of peers in this
torrent that are waiting for more bandwidth quota from the torrent rate limiter.
This can determine if the rate you get from this torrent is bound by the torrents
limit or not. If there is no limit set on this torrent, the peers might still be
waiting for bandwidth quota from the global limiter, but then they are counted in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_status</span></tt> object.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all_time_upload</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all_time_download</span></tt> are accumulated upload and download
payload byte counters. They are saved in and restored from resume data to keep totals
across sessions.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_time</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">finished_time</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seeding_time</span></tt> are second counters.
They keep track of the number of seconds this torrent has been active (not
paused) and the number of seconds it has been active while being finished and
active while being a seed. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seeding_time</span></tt> should be &lt;= <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">finished_time</span></tt> which
should be &lt;= <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_time</span></tt>. They are all saved in and restored from resume data,
to keep totals across sessions.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed_rank</span></tt> is a rank of how important it is to seed the torrent, it is used
to determine which torrents to seed and which to queue. It is based on the peer
to seed ratio from the tracker scrape. For more information, see <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">last_scrape</span></tt> is the number of seconds since this torrent acquired scrape data.
If it has never done that, this value is -1.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has_incoming</span></tt> is true if there has ever been an incoming connection attempt
to this torrent.'</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sparse_regions</span></tt> the number of regions of non-downloaded pieces in the
torrent. This is an interesting metric on windows vista, since there is
a limit on the number of sparse regions in a single file there.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed_mode</span></tt> is true if the torrent is in seed_mode. If the torrent was
started in seed mode, it will leave seed mode once all pieces have been
checked or as soon as one piece fails the hash check.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_mode</span></tt> is true if the torrent is blocked from downloading. This
typically happens when a disk write operation fails. If the torrent is
auto-managed, it will periodically be taken out of this state, in the
hope that the disk condition (be it disk full or permission errors) has
been resolved. If the torrent is not auto-managed, you have to explicitly
take it out of the upload mode by calling <a class="reference internal" href="#set-upload-mode">set_upload_mode()</a> on the
<a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-handle">torrent_handle</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">share_mode</span></tt> is true if the torrent is currently in share-mode, i.e.
not downloading the torrent, but just helping the swarm out.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super_seeding</span></tt> is true if the torrent is in super seeding mode.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">added_time</span></tt> is the posix-time when this torrent was added. i.e. what
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time(NULL)</span></tt> returned at the time.</p>

<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">read_state</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">write_state</span></tt> are bitmasks. A peer may be waiting
on disk and on the network at the same time. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bw_idle</span></tt> does not represent a bit,
but is simply a name for no bit being set in the bitmask.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ip</span></tt> field is the IP-address to this peer. The type is an asio endpoint. For
more info, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://asio.sf.net">asio</a> documentation.</p>

we have to and from this peer (including any protocol messages). The transfer rates
of payload data only are found in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">payload_up_speed</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">payload_down_speed</span></tt>.
These figures are updated approximately once every second.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_download</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_upload</span></tt> are the total number of bytes downloaded
from and uploaded to this peer. These numbers do not include the protocol chatter, but only
the payload data.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pid</span></tt> is the peer's id as used in the bit torrent protocol. This id can be used to
extract 'fingerprints' from the peer. Sometimes it can tell you which client the peer
is using. See identify_client()_</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pieces</span></tt> is a bitfield, with one bit per piece in the torrent.
Each bit tells you if the peer has that piece (if it's set to 1)
or if the peer miss that piece (set to 0).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed</span></tt> is true if this peer is a seed.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_limit</span></tt> is the number of bytes per second we are allowed to send to this
peer every second. It may be -1 if there's no local limit on the peer. The global
limit and the torrent limit is always enforced anyway.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">download_limit</span></tt> is the number of bytes per second this peer is allowed to

will time out. This timeout can be adjusted through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::request_timeout</span></tt>.
-1 means that there is not outstanding request.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_buffer_size</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">used_send_buffer</span></tt> is the number of bytes allocated

is connected from. If the country hasn't been resolved yet, both chars are set
to 0. If the resolution failed for some reason, the field is set to &quot;--&quot;. If the
resolution service returns an invalid country code, it is set to &quot;!!&quot;.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">countries.nerd.dk</span></tt> service is used to look up countries. This field will
remain set to 0 unless the torrent is set to resolve countries, see <a class="reference internal" href="#resolve-countries">resolve_countries()</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inet_as_name</span></tt> is the name of the AS this peer is located in. This might be

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inet_as</span></tt> is the AS number the peer is located in.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_balancing</span></tt> is a measurement of the balancing of free download (that we get)
and free upload that we give. Every peer gets a certain amount of free upload, but
this member says how much <em>extra</em> free upload this peer has got. If it is a negative
number it means that this was a peer from which we have got this amount of free
download.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">requests_in_buffer</span></tt> is the number of requests messages that are currently in the
send buffer waiting to be sent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">download_queue_length</span></tt> is the number of piece-requests we have sent to this peer
that hasn't been answered with a piece yet.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_queue_length</span></tt> is the number of piece-requests we have received from this peer
that we haven't answered with a piece yet.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">failcount</span></tt> is the number of times this peer has &quot;failed&quot;. i.e. failed to connect
or disconnected us. The failcount is decremented when we see this peer in a tracker
response or peer exchange message.</p>
<p>You can know which piece, and which part of that piece, that is currently being
downloaded from a specific peer by looking at the next four members.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloading_piece_index</span></tt> is the index of the piece that is currently being downloaded.
This may be set to -1 if there's currently no piece downloading from this peer. If it is
&gt;= 0, the other three members are valid. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloading_block_index</span></tt> is the index of the
block (or sub-piece) that is being downloaded. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloading_progress</span></tt> is the number
of bytes of this block we have received from the peer, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloading_total</span></tt> is
the total number of bytes in this block.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">client</span></tt> is a string describing the software at the other end of the connection.
In some cases this information is not available, then it will contain a string
that may give away something about which software is running in the other end.
In the case of a web seed, the server type and version will be a part of this
string.</p>

<h1>session customization</h1>
<p>You have some control over session configuration through the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings</span></tt> object. You
create it and fill it with your settings and then use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::set_settings()</span></tt>
to apply them.</p>
<p>You have control over proxy and authorization settings and also the user-agent
that will be sent to the tracker. The user-agent will also be used to identify the
client with other peers.</p>
<div class="section" id="presets">
<h2>presets</h2>
<p>The default values of the session settings are set for a regular bittorrent client running
on a desktop system. There are functions that can set the session settings to pre set
settings for other environments. These can be used for the basis, and should be tweaked to
fit your needs better.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
session_settings min_memory_usage();
session_settings high_performance_seed();
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min_memory_usage</span></tt> returns settings that will use the minimal amount of RAM, at the
potential expense of upload and download performance. It adjusts the socket buffer sizes,
disables the disk cache, lowers the send buffer watermarks so that each connection only has
at most one block in use at any one time. It lowers the outstanding blocks send to the disk
I/O thread so that connections only have one block waiting to be flushed to disk at any given
time. It lowers the max number of peers in the peer list for torrents. It performs multiple
smaller reads when it hashes pieces, instead of reading it all into memory before hashing.</p>
<p>This configuration is inteded to be the starting point for embedded devices. It will
significantly reduce memory usage.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">high_performance_seed</span></tt> returns settings optimized for a seed box, serving many peers
and that doesn't do any downloading. It has a 128 MB disk cache and has a limit of 400 files
in its file pool. It support fast upload rates by allowing large send buffers.</p>

</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">version</span></tt> is automatically set to the libtorrent version you're using
in order to be forward binary compatible. This field should not be changed.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_agent</span></tt> this is the client identification to the tracker.
The recommended format of this string is:
&quot;ClientName/ClientVersion libtorrent/libtorrentVersion&quot;.
This name will not only be used when making HTTP requests, but also when
sending extended headers to peers that support that extension.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tracker_completion_timeout</span></tt> is the number of seconds the tracker
connection will wait from when it sent the request until it considers the
tracker to have timed-out. Default value is 60 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tracker_receive_timeout</span></tt> is the number of seconds to wait to receive
any data from the tracker. If no data is received for this number of
seconds, the tracker will be considered as having timed out. If a tracker
is down, this is the kind of timeout that will occur. The default value
is 20 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop_tracker_timeout</span></tt> is the time to wait for tracker responses when
shutting down the session object. This is given in seconds. Default is
10 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tracker_maximum_response_length</span></tt> is the maximum number of bytes in a
tracker response. If a response size passes this number it will be rejected
and the connection will be closed. On gzipped responses this size is measured
on the uncompressed data. So, if you get 20 bytes of gzip response that'll
expand to 2 megs, it will be interrupted before the entire response has been
uncompressed (given your limit is lower than 2 megs). Default limit is
1 megabyte.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">piece_timeout</span></tt> controls the number of seconds from a request is sent until
it times out if no piece response is returned.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">request_queue_time</span></tt> is the length of the request queue given in the number
of seconds it should take for the other end to send all the pieces. i.e. the
actual number of requests depends on the download rate and this number.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_allowed_in_request_queue</span></tt> is the number of outstanding block requests
a peer is allowed to queue up in the client. If a peer sends more requests
than this (before the first one has been handled) the last request will be
dropped. The higher this is, the faster upload speeds the client can get to a
single peer.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_out_request_queue</span></tt> is the maximum number of outstanding requests to
send to a peer. This limit takes precedence over <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">request_queue_time</span></tt>. i.e.
no matter the download speed, the number of outstanding requests will never
exceed this limit.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whole_pieces_threshold</span></tt> is a limit in seconds. if a whole piece can be
downloaded in at least this number of seconds from a specific peer, the
peer_connection will prefer requesting whole pieces at a time from this peer.
The benefit of this is to better utilize disk caches by doing localized
accesses and also to make it easier to identify bad peers if a piece fails
the hash check.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_timeout</span></tt> is the number of seconds the peer connection should
wait (for any activity on the peer connection) before closing it due
to time out. This defaults to 120 seconds, since that's what's specified
in the protocol specification. After half the time out, a keep alive message
is sent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">urlseed_timeout</span></tt> is the same as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_timeout</span></tt> but applies only to
url seeds. This value defaults to 20 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">urlseed_pipeline_size</span></tt> controls the pipelining with the web server. When
using persistent connections to HTTP 1.1 servers, the client is allowed to
send more requests before the first response is received. This number controls
the number of outstanding requests to use with url-seeds. Default is 5.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file_pool_size</span></tt> is the the upper limit on the total number of files this
session will keep open. The reason why files are left open at all is that
some anti virus software hooks on every file close, and scans the file for
viruses. deferring the closing of the files will be the difference between
a usable system and a completely hogged down system. Most operating systems
also has a limit on the total number of file descriptors a process may have
open. It is usually a good idea to find this limit and set the number of
connections and the number of files limits so their sum is slightly below it.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">allow_multiple_connections_per_ip</span></tt> determines if connections from the
same IP address as existing connections should be rejected or not. Multiple
connections from the same IP address is not allowed by default, to prevent
abusive behavior by peers. It may be useful to allow such connections in
cases where simulations are run on the same machie, and all peers in a
swarm has the same IP address.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_failcount</span></tt> is the maximum times we try to connect to a peer before
stop connecting again. If a peer succeeds, the failcounter is reset. If
a peer is retrieved from a peer source (other than DHT) the failcount is
decremented by one, allowing another try.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min_reconnect_time</span></tt> is the time to wait between connection attempts. If
the peer fails, the time is multiplied by fail counter.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_connect_timeout</span></tt> the number of seconds to wait after a connection
attempt is initiated to a peer until it is considered as having timed out.
The default is 10 seconds. This setting is especially important in case
the number of half-open connections are limited, since stale half-open
connection may delay the connection of other peers considerably.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ignore_limits_on_local_network</span></tt>, if set to true, upload, download and
unchoke limits are ignored for peers on the local network.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connection_speed</span></tt> is the number of connection attempts that
are made per second. If a number &lt; 0 is specified, it will default to
200 connections per second. If 0 is specified, it means don't make
outgoing connections at all.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_redundant_have</span></tt> controls if have messages will be sent
to peers that already have the piece. This is typically not necessary,
but it might be necessary for collecting statistics in some cases.
Default is false.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lazy_bitfields</span></tt> prevents outgoing bitfields from being full. If the
client is seed, a few bits will be set to 0, and later filled in with
have-messages. This is to prevent certain ISPs from stopping people
from seeding.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inactivity_timeout</span></tt>, if a peer is uninteresting and uninterested
for longer than this number of seconds, it will be disconnected.
Default is 10 minutes</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unchoke_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds between chokes/unchokes.
On this interval, peers are re-evaluated for being choked/unchoked. This
is defined as 30 seconds in the protocol, and it should be significantly
longer than what it takes for TCP to ramp up to it's max rate.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimistic_unchoke_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds between
each <em>optimistic</em> unchoke. On this timer, the currently optimistically
unchoked peer will change.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">announce_ip</span></tt> is the ip address passed along to trackers as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;ip=</span></tt> parameter.
If left as the default (an empty string), that parameter is omitted.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_want</span></tt> is the number of peers we want from each tracker request. It defines
what is sent as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;num_want=</span></tt> parameter to the tracker.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initial_picker_threshold</span></tt> specifies the number of pieces we need before we
switch to rarest first picking. This defaults to 4, which means the 4 first
pieces in any torrent are picked at random, the following pieces are picked
in rarest first order.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">allowed_fast_set_size</span></tt> is the number of pieces we allow peers to download
from us without being unchoked.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suggest_mode</span></tt> controls whether or not libtorrent will send out suggest
messages to create a bias of its peers to request certain pieces. The modes
are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no_piece_suggestsions</span></tt> which is the default and will not send out suggest
messages.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suggest_read_cache</span></tt> which will send out suggest messages for the most
recent pieces that are in the read cache.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_queued_disk_bytes</span></tt> is the number maximum number of bytes, to be
written to disk, that can wait in the disk I/O thread queue. This queue
is only for waiting for the disk I/O thread to receive the job and either
write it to disk or insert it in the write cache. When this limit is reached,
the peer connections will stop reading data from their sockets, until the disk
thread catches up. Setting this too low will severly limit your download rate.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">handshake_timeout</span></tt> specifies the number of seconds we allow a peer to
delay responding to a protocol handshake. If no response is received within
this time, the connection is closed.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_dht_as_fallback</span></tt> determines how the DHT is used. If this is true,
the DHT will only be used for torrents where all trackers in its tracker
list has failed. Either by an explicit error message or a time out. This
is false by default, which means the DHT is used by default regardless of
if the trackers fail or not.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">free_torrent_hashes</span></tt> determines whether or not the torrent's piece hashes
are kept in memory after the torrent becomes a seed or not. If it is set to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt> the hashes are freed once the torrent is a seed (they're not
needed anymore since the torrent won't download anything more). If it's set
to false they are not freed. If they are freed, the <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-info">torrent_info</a> returned
by get_torrent_info() will return an object that may be incomplete, that
cannot be passed back to <a class="reference internal" href="#async-add-torrent-add-torrent">async_add_torrent() add_torrent()</a> for instance.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upnp_ignore_nonrouters</span></tt> indicates whether or not the UPnP implementation
should ignore any broadcast response from a device whose address is not the
configured router for this machine. i.e. it's a way to not talk to other
people's routers by mistake.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_buffer_watermark</span></tt> is the upper limit of the send buffer low-watermark.
if the send buffer has fewer bytes than this, we'll read another 16kB block
onto it. If set too small, upload rate capacity will suffer. If set too high,
memory will be wasted. The actual watermark may be lower than this in case
the upload rate is low, this is the upper limit.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_buffer_watermark_factor</span></tt> is multiplied to the peer's upload rate
to determine the low-watermark for the peer. It is specified as a percentage,
which means 100 represents a factor of 1.
The low-watermark is still clamped to not exceed the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_buffer_watermark</span></tt>
upper limit. This defaults to 50. For high capacity connections, setting this
higher can improve upload performance and disk throughput. Setting it too
high may waste RAM and create a bias towards read jobs over write jobs.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_upload_slots</span></tt> defaults to true. When true, if there is a global upload
limit set and the current upload rate is less than 90% of that, another upload
slot is opened. If the upload rate has been saturated for an extended period
of time, on upload slot is closed. The number of upload slots will never be
less than what has been set by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::set_max_uploads()</span></tt>. To query the
current number of upload slots, see <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_status::allowed_upload_slots</span></tt>.</p>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_upload_slots_rate_based</span></tt> is set, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_upload_slots</span></tt> is set,
the max upload slots setting is used as a minimum number of unchoked slots.
This algorithm is designed to prevent the peer from spreading its upload
capacity too thin, but still open more slots in order to utilize the full capacity.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">choking_algorithm</span></tt> specifies which algorithm to use to determine which peers
to unchoke. This setting replaces the deprecated settings <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_upload_slots</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_upload_slots_rate_based</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The options for choking algorithms are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fixed_slots_choker</span></tt> is the traditional choker with a fixed number of unchoke
slots (as specified by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::set_max_uploads()</span></tt>).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_expand_choker</span></tt> opens at least the number of slots as specified by
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::set_max_uploads()</span></tt> but opens up more slots if the upload capacity
is not saturated. This unchoker will work just like the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fixed_slot_choker</span></tt>
if there's no global upload rate limit set.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rate_based_choker</span></tt> opens up unchoke slots based on the upload rate
achieved to peers. The more slots that are opened, the marginal upload
rate required to open up another slot increases.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bittyrant_choker</span></tt> attempts to optimize download rate by finding the
reciprocation rate of each peer individually and prefers peers that gives
the highest <em>return on investment</em>. It still allocates all upload capacity,
but shuffles it around to the best peers first. For this choker to be
efficient, you need to set a global upload rate limit
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::set_upload_rate_limit()</span></tt>). For more information about this
choker, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://bittyrant.cs.washington.edu/#papers">paper</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed_choking_algorithm</span></tt> controls the seeding unchoke behavior. The available
options are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">round_robin</span></tt> which round-robins the peers that are unchoked when seeding. This
distributes the upload bandwidht uniformly and fairly. It minimizes the ability
for a peer to download everything without redistributing it.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fastest_upload</span></tt> unchokes the peers we can send to the fastest. This might be
a bit more reliable in utilizing all available capacity.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">anti_leech</span></tt> prioritizes peers who have just started or are just about to finish
the download. The intention is to force peers in the middle of the download to
trade with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_parole_mode</span></tt> specifies if parole mode should be used. Parole mode means
that peers that participate in pieces that fail the hash check are put in a mode
where they are only allowed to download whole pieces. If the whole piece a peer
in parole mode fails the hash check, it is banned. If a peer participates in a
piece that passes the hash check, it is taken out of parole mode.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cache_size</span></tt> is the disk write and read  cache. It is specified in units of
16 KiB blocks. Buffers that are part of a peer's send or receive buffer also
count against this limit. Send and receive buffers will never be denied to be
allocated, but they will cause the actual cached blocks to be flushed or evicted.
If this is set to -1, the cache size is automatically set to the amount
of physical RAM available in the machine divided by 8. If the amount of physical
RAM cannot be determined, it's set to 1024 (= 16 MiB).</p>
<p>Disk buffers are allocated using a pool allocator, the number of blocks that
are allocated at a time when the pool needs to grow can be specified in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cache_buffer_chunk_size</span></tt>. This defaults to 16 blocks. Lower numbers
saves memory at the expense of more heap allocations. It must be at least 1.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cache_expiry</span></tt> is the number of seconds from the last cached write to a piece
in the write cache, to when it's forcefully flushed to disk. Default is 60 second.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_read_cache</span></tt>, is set to true (default), the disk cache is also used to
cache pieces read from disk. Blocks for writing pieces takes presedence.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">explicit_read_cache</span></tt> defaults to 0. If set to something greater than 0, the
disk read cache will not be evicted by cache misses and will explicitly be
controlled based on the rarity of pieces. Rare pieces are more likely to be
cached. This would typically be used together with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suggest_mode</span></tt> set to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suggest_read_cache</span></tt>. The value is the number of pieces to keep in the read
cache. If the actual read cache can't fit as many, it will essentially be clamped.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">explicit_cache_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds in between each refresh of
a part of the explicit read cache. Torrents take turns in refreshing and this
is the time in between each torrent refresh. Refreshing a torrent's explicit
read cache means scanning all pieces and picking a random set of the rarest ones.
There is an affinity to pick pieces that are already in the cache, so that
subsequent refreshes only swaps in pieces that are rarer than whatever is in
the cache at the time.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disk_io_write_mode</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disk_io_read_mode</span></tt> determines how files are
opened when they're in read only mode versus read and write mode. The options
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>enable_os_cache</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">This is the default and files are opened normally, with the OS caching
reads and writes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>disable_os_cache_for_aligned_files</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">This will open files in unbuffered mode for files where every read and
write would be sector aligned. Using aligned disk offsets is a requirement
on some operating systems.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>disable_os_cache</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">This opens all files in unbuffered mode (if allowed by the operating system).
Linux and Windows, for instance, require disk offsets to be sector aligned,
and in those cases, this option is the same as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disable_os_caches_for_aligned_files</span></tt>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One reason to disable caching is that it may help the operating system from growing
its file cache indefinitely. Since some OSes only allow aligned files to be opened
in unbuffered mode, It is recommended to make the largest file in a torrent the first
file (with offset 0) or use pad files to align all files to piece boundries.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">outgoing_ports</span></tt>, if set to something other than (0, 0) is a range of ports
used to bind outgoing sockets to. This may be useful for users whose router
allows them to assign QoS classes to traffic based on its local port. It is
a range instead of a single port because of the problems with failing to reconnect
to peers if a previous socket to that peer and port is in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TIME_WAIT</span></tt> state.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">setting outgoing ports will limit the ability to keep multiple
connections to the same client, even for different torrents. It is not
recommended to change this setting. Its main purpose is to use as an
escape hatch for cheap routers with QoS capability but can only classify
flows based on port numbers.</p>
</div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_tos</span></tt> determines the TOS byte set in the IP header of every packet
sent to peers (including web seeds). The default value for this is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x0</span></tt>
(no marking). One potentially useful TOS mark is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x20</span></tt>, this represents
the <em>QBone scavenger service</em>. For more details, see <a class="reference external" href="http://qbone.internet2.edu/qbss/">QBSS</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> controls how many active seeding and
downloading torrents the queuing mechanism allows. The target number of active
torrents is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min(active_downloads</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">active_seeds,</span> <span class="pre">active_limit)</span></tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> are upper limits on the number of
downloading torrents and seeding torrents respectively. Setting the value to
-1 means unlimited.</p>
<p>For example if there are 10 seeding torrents and 10 downloading torrents, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt> is 4 and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> is 4, there will be 4 seeds
active and 4 downloading torrents. If the settings are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt> = 2
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> = 4, then there will be 2 downloading torrents and 4 seeding
torrents active. Torrents that are not auto managed are also counted against these
limits. If there are non-auto managed torrents that use up all the slots, no
auto managed torrent will be activated.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_manage_prefer_seeds</span></tt> specifies if libtorrent should prefer giving seeds
active slots or downloading torrents.  The default is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt>.</p>
<p>if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dont_count_slow_torrents</span></tt> is true, torrents without any payload transfers are
not subject to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt> limits. This is intended
to make it more likely to utilize all available bandwidth, and avoid having torrents
that don't transfer anything block the active slots.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_limit</span></tt> is a hard limit on the number of active torrents. This applies even to
slow torrents.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_dht_limit</span></tt> is the max number of torrents to announce to the DHT. By default
this is set to 88, which is no more than one DHT announce every 10 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_tracker_limit</span></tt> is the max number of torrents to announce to their trackers.
By default this is 360, which is no more than one announce every 5 seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_lsd_limit</span></tt> is the max number of torrents to announce to the local network
over the local service discovery protocol. By default this is 80, which is no more
than one announce every 5 seconds (assuming the default announce interval of 5 minutes).</p>
<p>You can have more torrents <em>active</em>, even though they are not announced to the DHT,
lsd or their tracker. If some peer knows about you for any reason and tries to connect,
it will still be accepted, unless the torrent is paused, which means it won't accept
any connections.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_manage_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds between the torrent queue
is updated, and rotated.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">share_ratio_limit</span></tt> is the upload / download ratio limit for considering a
seeding torrent have met the seed limit criteria. See <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed_time_ratio_limit</span></tt> is the seeding time / downloading time ratio limit
for considering a seeding torrent to have met the seed limit criteria. See <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed_time_limit</span></tt> is the limit on the time a torrent has been an active seed
(specified in seconds) before it is considered having met the seed limit criteria.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#queuing">queuing</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_turnover_interval</span></tt> controls a feature where libtorrent periodically can disconnect
the least useful peers in the hope of connecting to better ones. This settings controls
the interval of this optimistic disconnect. It defaults to every 5 minutes, and
is specified in seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_turnover</span></tt> Is the fraction of the peers that are disconnected. This is
a float where 1.f represents all peers an 0 represents no peers. It defaults to
4% (i.e. 0.04f)</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_turnover_cutoff</span></tt> is the cut off trigger for optimistic unchokes. If a torrent
has more than this fraction of its connection limit, the optimistic unchoke is
triggered. This defaults to 90% (i.e. 0.9f).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">close_redundant_connections</span></tt> specifies whether libtorrent should close
connections where both ends have no utility in keeping the connection open.
For instance if both ends have completed their downloads, there's no point
in keeping it open. This defaults to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_scrape_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds between scrapes of
queued torrents (auto managed and paused torrents). Auto managed
torrents that are paused, are scraped regularly in order to keep
track of their downloader/seed ratio. This ratio is used to determine
which torrents to seed and which to pause.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_scrape_min_interval</span></tt> is the minimum number of seconds between any
automatic scrape (regardless of torrent). In case there are a large number
of paused auto managed torrents, this puts a limit on how often a scrape
request is sent.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_peerlist_size</span></tt> is the maximum number of peers in the list of
known peers. These peers are not necessarily connected, so this number
should be much greater than the maximum number of connected peers.
Peers are evicted from the cache when the list grows passed 90% of
this limit, and once the size hits the limit, peers are no longer
added to the list. If this limit is set to 0, there is no limit on
how many peers we'll keep in the peer list.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_paused_peerlist_size</span></tt> is the max peer list size used for torrents
that are paused. This default to the same as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_peerlist_size</span></tt>, but
can be used to save memory for paused torrents, since it's not as
important for them to keep a large peer list.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min_announce_interval</span></tt> is the minimum allowed announce interval
for a tracker. This is specified in seconds, defaults to 5 minutes and
is used as a sanity check on what is returned from a tracker. It
mitigates hammering misconfigured trackers.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prioritize_partial_pieces</span></tt> is true, partial pieces are picked
before pieces that are more rare. If false, rare pieces are always
prioritized, unless the number of partial pieces is growing out of
proportion.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_manage_startup</span></tt> is the number of seconds a torrent is considered
active after it was started, regardless of upload and download speed. This
is so that newly started torrents are not considered inactive until they
have a fair chance to start downloading.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rate_limit_ip_overhead</span></tt> is set to true, the estimated TCP/IP overhead is
drained from the rate limiters, to avoid exceeding the limits with the total traffic</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">announce_to_all_trackers</span></tt> controls how multi tracker torrents are
treated. If this is set to true, all trackers in the same tier are
announced to in parallel. If all trackers in tier 0 fails, all trackers
in tier 1 are announced as well. If it's set to false, the behavior is as
defined by the multi tracker specification. It defaults to false, which
is the same behavior previous versions of libtorrent has had as well.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">announce_to_all_tiers</span></tt> also controls how multi tracker torrents are
treated. When this is set to true, one tracker from each tier is announced
to. This is the uTorrent behavior. This is false by default in order
to comply with the multi-tracker specification.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prefer_udp_trackers</span></tt> is true by default. It means that trackers may
be rearranged in a way that udp trackers are always tried before http
trackers for the same hostname. Setting this to fails means that the
trackers' tier is respected and there's no preference of one protocol
over another.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">strict_super_seeding</span></tt> when this is set to true, a piece has to
have been forwarded to a third peer before another one is handed out.
This is the traditional definition of super seeding.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seeding_piece_quota</span></tt> is the number of pieces to send to a peer,
when seeding, before rotating in another peer to the unchoke set.
It defaults to 3 pieces, which means that when seeding, any peer we've
sent more than this number of pieces to will be unchoked in favour of
a choked peer.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_sparse_regions</span></tt> is a limit of the number of <em>sparse regions</em> in
a torrent. A sparse region is defined as a hole of pieces we have not
yet downloaded, in between pieces that have been downloaded. This is
used as a hack for windows vista which has a bug where you cannot
write files with more than a certain number of sparse regions. This
limit is not hard, it will be exceeded. Once it's exceeded, pieces
that will maintain or decrease the number of sparse regions are
prioritized. To disable this functionality, set this to 0. It defaults
to 0 on all platforms except windows.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock_disk_cache</span></tt> if lock disk cache is set to true the disk cache
that's in use, will be locked in physical memory, preventing it from
being swapped out.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_rejects</span></tt> is the number of piece requests we will reject in a row
while a peer is choked before the peer is considered abusive and is
disconnected.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">recv_socket_buffer_size</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send_socket_buffer_size</span></tt> specifies
the buffer sizes set on peer sockets. 0 (which is the default) means
the OS default (i.e. don't change the buffer sizes). The socket buffer
sizes are changed using setsockopt() with SOL_SOCKET/SO_RCVBUF and
SO_SNDBUFFER.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimize_hashing_for_speed</span></tt> chooses between two ways of reading back
piece data from disk when its complete and needs to be verified against
the piece hash. This happens if some blocks were flushed to the disk
out of order. Everything that is flushed in order is hashed as it goes
along. Optimizing for speed will allocate space to fit all the the
remaingin, unhashed, part of the piece, reads the data into it in a single
call and hashes it. This is the default. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimizing_hashing_for_speed</span></tt>
is false, a single block will be allocated (16 kB), and the unhashed parts
of the piece are read, one at a time, and hashed in this single block. This
is appropriate on systems that are memory constrained.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file_checks_delay_per_block</span></tt> is the number of milliseconds to sleep
in between disk read operations when checking torrents. This defaults
to 0, but can be set to higher numbers to slow down the rate at which
data is read from the disk while checking. This may be useful for
background tasks that doesn't matter if they take a bit longer, as long
as they leave disk I/O time for other processes.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disk_cache_algorithm</span></tt> tells the disk I/O thread which cache flush
algorithm to use. The default algorithm is largest_contiguous. This
flushes the entire piece, in the write cache, that was least recently
written to. This is specified by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::lru</span></tt> enum
value. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::largest_contiguous</span></tt> will flush the largest
sequences of contiguous blocks from the write cache, regarless of the
piece's last use time. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::avoid_readback</span></tt> will prioritize
flushing blocks that will avoid having to read them back in to verify
the hash of the piece once it's done. This is especially useful for high
throughput setups, where reading from the disk is especially expensive.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">read_cache_line_size</span></tt> is the number of blocks to read into the read
cache when a read cache miss occurs. Setting this to 0 is essentially
the same thing as disabling read cache. The number of blocks read
into the read cache is always capped by the piece boundry.</p>
<p>When a piece in the write cache has <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">write_cache_line_size</span></tt> contiguous
blocks in it, they will be flushed. Setting this to 1 effectively
disables the write cache.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimistic_disk_retry</span></tt> is the number of seconds from a disk write
errors occur on a torrent until libtorrent will take it out of the
upload mode, to test if the error condition has been fixed.</p>
<p>libtorrent will only do this automatically for auto managed torrents.</p>
<p>You can explicitly take a torrent out of upload only mode using
<a class="reference internal" href="#set-upload-mode">set_upload_mode()</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disable_hash_check</span></tt> controls if downloaded pieces are verified against
the piece hashes in the torrent file or not. The default is false, i.e.
to verify all downloaded data. It may be useful to turn this off for performance
profiling and simulation scenarios. Do not disable the hash check for regular
bittorrent clients.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_suggest_pieces</span></tt> is the max number of suggested piece indices received
from a peer that's remembered. If a peer floods suggest messages, this limit
prevents libtorrent from using too much RAM. It defaults to 10.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drop_skipped_requests</span></tt> is set to true (it defaults to false), piece
requests that have been skipped enough times when piece messages
are received, will be considered lost. Requests are considered skipped
when the returned piece messages are re-ordered compared to the order
of the requests. This was an attempt to get out of dead-locks caused by
BitComet peers silently ignoring some requests. It may cause problems
at high rates, and high level of reordering in the uploading peer, that's
why it's disabled by default.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">low_prio_disk</span></tt> determines if the disk I/O should use a normal
or low priority policy. This defaults to true, which means that
it's low priority by default. Other processes doing disk I/O will
normally take priority in this mode. This is meant to improve the
overall responsiveness of the system while downloading in the
background. For high-performance server setups, this might not
be desirable.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_service_announce_interval</span></tt> is the time between local
network announces for a torrent. By default, when local service
discovery is enabled a torrent announces itself every 5 minutes.
This interval is specified in seconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dht_announce_interval</span></tt> is the number of seconds between announcing
torrents to the distributed hash table (DHT). This is specified to
be 15 minutes which is its default.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dht_max_torrents</span></tt> is the max number of torrents we will track
in the DHT.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">udp_tracker_token_expiry</span></tt> is the number of seconds libtorrent
will keep UDP tracker connection tokens around for. This is specified
to be 60 seconds, and defaults to that. The higher this value is, the
fewer packets have to be sent to the UDP tracker. In order for higher
values to work, the tracker needs to be configured to match the
expiration time for tokens.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">volatile_read_cache</span></tt>, if this is set to true, read cache blocks
that are hit by peer read requests are removed from the disk cache
to free up more space. This is useful if you don't expect the disk
cache to create any cache hits from other peers than the one who
triggered the cache line to be read into the cache in the first place.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">guided_read_cache</span></tt> enables the disk cache to adjust the size
of a cache line generated by peers to depend on the upload rate
you are sending to that peer. The intention is to optimize the RAM
usage of the cache, to read ahead further for peers that you're
sending faster to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default_min_cache_age</span></tt> is the minimum number of seconds any read
cache line is kept in the cache. This defaults to one second but
may be greater if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">guided_read_cache</span></tt> is enabled. Having a lower
bound on the time a cache line stays in the cache is an attempt
to avoid swapping the same pieces in and out of the cache in case
there is a shortage of spare cache space.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_optimistic_unchoke_slots</span></tt> is the number of optimistic unchoke
slots to use. It defaults to 0, which means automatic. Having a higher
number of optimistic unchoke slots mean you will find the good peers
faster but with the trade-off to use up more bandwidth. When this is
set to 0, libtorrent opens up 20% of your allowed upload slots as
optimistic unchoke slots.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no_atime_storage</span></tt> this is a linux-only option and passes in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">O_NOATIME</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">open()</span></tt> when opening files. This may lead to
some disk performance improvements.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default_est_reciprocation_rate</span></tt> is the assumed reciprocation rate
from peers when using the BitTyrant choker. This defaults to 14 kiB/s.
If set too high, you will over-estimate your peers and be more altruistic
while finding the true reciprocation rate, if it's set too low, you'll
be too stingy and waste finding the true reciprocation rate.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">increase_est_reciprocation_rate</span></tt> specifies how many percent the
extimated reciprocation rate should be increased by each unchoke
interval a peer is still choking us back. This defaults to 20%.
This only applies to the BitTyrant choker.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decrease_est_reciprocation_rate</span></tt> specifies how many percent the
estimated reciprocation rate should be decreased by each unchoke
interval a peer unchokes us. This default to 3%.
This only applies to the BitTyrant choker.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">incoming_starts_queued_torrents</span></tt> defaults to false. If a torrent
has been paused by the auto managed feature in libtorrent, i.e.
the torrent is paused and auto managed, this feature affects whether
or not it is automatically started on an incoming connection. The
main reason to queue torrents, is not to make them unavailable, but
to save on the overhead of announcing to the trackers, the DHT and to
avoid spreading one's unchoke slots too thin. If a peer managed to
find us, even though we're no in the torrent anymore, this setting
can make us start the torrent and serve it.</p>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">report_true_downloaded</span></tt> is true, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;downloaded=</span></tt> argument
sent to trackers will include redundant downloaded bytes. It defaults
to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt>, which means redundant bytes are not reported to the tracker.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">strict_end_game_mode</span></tt> defaults to true, and controls when a block
may be requested twice. If this is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>, a block may only be requested
twice when there's ay least one request to every piece that's left to
download in the torrent. This may slow down progress on some pieces
sometimes, but it may also avoid downloading a lot of redundant bytes.
If this is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt>, libtorrent attempts to use each peer connection
to its max, by always requesting something, even if it means requesting
something that has been requested from another peer already.</p>
<p>if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">broadcast_lsd</span></tt> is set to true, the local peer discovery
(or Local Service Discovery) will not only use IP multicast, but also
broadcast its messages. This can be useful when running on networks
that don't support multicast. Since broadcast messages might be
expensive and disruptive on networks, only every 8th announce uses
broadcast.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_outgoing_utp</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_incoming_utp</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_outgoing_tcp</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_incoming_tcp</span></tt> all determines if libtorrent should attempt to make
outgoing connections of the specific type, or allow incoming connection. By
default all of them are enabled.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ignore_resume_timestamps</span></tt> determines if the storage, when loading
resume data files, should verify that the file modification time
with the timestamps in the resume data. This defaults to false, which
means timestamps are taken into account, and resume data is less likely
to accepted (torrents are more likely to be fully checked when loaded).
It might be useful to set this to true if your network is faster than your
disk, and it would be faster to redownload potentially missed pieces than
to go through the whole storage to look for them.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no_recheck_incomplete_resume</span></tt> determines if the storage should check
the whole files when resume data is incomplete or missing or whether
it should simply assume we don't have any of the data. By default, this
is determined by the existance of any of the files. By setting this setting
to true, the files won't be checked, but will go straight to download
mode.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">anonymous_mode</span></tt> defaults to false. When set to true, the client tries
to hide its identity to a certain degree. The peer-ID will no longer
include the client's fingerprint. The user-agent will be reset to an
empty string. Trackers will only be used if they are using a proxy
server. The listen sockets are closed, and incoming connections will
only be accepted through a SOCKS5 or I2P proxy (if a peer proxy is set up and
is run on the same machine as the tracker proxy). Since no incoming connections
are accepted, NAT-PMP, UPnP, DHT and local peer discovery are all turned off
when this setting is enabled.</p>
<p>If you're using I2P, it might make sense to enable anonymous mode as well.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tick_interval</span></tt> specifies the number of milliseconds between internal
ticks. This is the frequency with which bandwidth quota is distributed to
peers. It should not be more than one second (i.e. 1000 ms). Setting this
to a low value (around 100) means higher resolution bandwidth quota distribution,
setting it to a higher value saves CPU cycles.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">share_mode_target</span></tt> specifies the target share ratio for share mode torrents.
This defaults to 3, meaning we'll try to upload 3 times as much as we download.
Setting this very high, will make it very conservative and you might end up
not downloading anything ever (and not affecting your share ratio). It does
not make any sense to set this any lower than 2. For instance, if only 3 peers
need to download the rarest piece, it's impossible to download a single piece
and upload it more than 3 times. If the share_mode_target is set to more than 3,
nothing is downloaded.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_rate_limit</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">download_rate_limit</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_upload_rate_limit</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_download_rate_limit</span></tt> sets the session-global limits of upload
and download rate limits, in bytes per second. The local rates refer to peers
on the local network. By default peers on the local network are not rate limited.</p>
<p>These rate limits are only used for local peers (peers within the same subnet as
the client itself) and it is only used when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::ignore_limits_on_local_network</span></tt>
is set to true (which it is by default). These rate limits default to unthrottled,
but can be useful in case you want to treat local peers preferentially, but not
quite unthrottled.</p>
<p>A value of 0 means unlimited.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dht_upload_rate_limit</span></tt> sets the rate limit on the DHT. This is specified in
bytes per second and defaults to 4000. For busy boxes with lots of torrents
that requires more DHT traffic, this should be raised.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unchoke_slots_limit</span></tt> is the mac number of unchoked peers in the session.</p>
<p>The number of unchoke slots may be ignored depending on what
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">choking_algorithm</span></tt> is set to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">half_open_limit</span></tt> sets the maximum number of half-open connections
libtorrent will have when connecting to peers. A half-open connection is one
where connect() has been called, but the connection still hasn't been established
(nor failed). Windows XP Service Pack 2 sets a default, system wide, limit of
the number of half-open connections to 10. So, this limit can be used to work
nicer together with other network applications on that system. The default is
to have no limit, and passing -1 as the limit, means to have no limit. When
limiting the number of simultaneous connection attempts, peers will be put in
a queue waiting for their turn to get connected.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connections_limit</span></tt> sets a global limit on the number of connections
opened. The number of connections is set to a hard minimum of at least two per
torrent, so if you set a too low connections limit, and open too many torrents,
the limit will not be met.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_target_delay</span></tt> is the target delay for uTP sockets in milliseconds. A high
value will make uTP connections more aggressive and cause longer queues in the upload
bottleneck. It cannot be too low, since the noise in the measurements would cause
it to send too slow. The default is 50 milliseconds.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_gain_factor</span></tt> is the number of bytes the uTP congestion window can increase
at the most in one RTT. This defaults to 300 bytes. If this is set too high,
the congestion controller reacts too hard to noise and will not be stable, if it's
set too low, it will react slow to congestion and not back off as fast.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_min_timeout</span></tt> is the shortest allowed uTP socket timeout, specified in milliseconds.
This defaults to 500 milliseconds. The timeout depends on the RTT of the connection, but
is never smaller than this value. A connection times out when every packet in a window
is lost, or when a packet is lost twice in a row (i.e. the resent packet is lost as well).</p>
<p>The shorter the timeout is, the faster the connection will recover from this situation,
assuming the RTT is low enough.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_syn_resends</span></tt> is the number of SYN packets that are sent (and timed out) before
giving up and closing the socket.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_num_resends</span></tt> is the number of times a packet is sent (and lossed or timed out)
before giving up and closing the connection.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_connect_timeout</span></tt> is the number of milliseconds of timeout for the initial SYN
packet for uTP connections. For each timed out packet (in a row), the timeout is doubled.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_delayed_ack</span></tt> is the number of milliseconds to delay ACKs the most. Delaying ACKs
significantly helps reducing the amount of protocol overhead in the reverse direction
from downloads. It defaults to 100 milliseconds. If set to 0, delayed ACKs are disabled
and every incoming payload packet is ACKed. The granularity of this timer is capped by
the tick interval (as specified by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tick_interval</span></tt>).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_dynamic_sock_buf</span></tt> controls if the uTP socket manager is allowed to increase
the socket buffer if a network interface with a large MTU is used (such as loopback
or ethernet jumbo frames). This defaults to true and might improve uTP throughput.
For RAM constrained systems, disabling this typically saves around 30kB in user space
and probably around 400kB in kernel socket buffers (it adjusts the send and receive
buffer size on the kernel socket, both for IPv4 and IPv6).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">utp_loss_multiplier</span></tt> controls how the congestion window is changed when a packet
loss is experienced. It's specified as a percentage multiplier for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cwnd</span></tt>. By default
it's set to 50 (i.e. cut in half). Do not change this value unless you know what
you're doing. Never set it higher than 100.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mixed_mode_algorithm</span></tt> determines how to treat TCP connections when there are
uTP connections. Since uTP is designed to yield to TCP, there's an inherent problem
when using swarms that have both TCP and uTP connections. If nothing is done, uTP
connections would often be starved out for bandwidth by the TCP connections. This mode
is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prefer_tcp</span></tt>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peer_proportional</span></tt> mode simply looks at the current throughput
and rate limits all TCP connections to their proportional share based on how many of
the connections are TCP. This works best if uTP connections are not rate limited by
the global rate limiter (which they aren't by default).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rate_limit_utp</span></tt> determines if uTP connections should be throttled by the global rate
limiter or not. By default they are not, since uTP manages its own rate.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">listen_queue_size</span></tt> is the value passed in to listen() for the listen socket.
It is the number of outstanding incoming connections to queue up while we're not
actively waiting for a connection to be accepted. The default is 5 which should
be sufficient for any normal client. If this is a high performance server which
expects to receive a lot of connections, or used in a simulator or test, it
might make sense to raise this number. It will not take affect until listen_on()
is called again (or for the first time).</p>
<p>if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">announce_double_nat</span></tt> is true, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;ip=</span></tt> argument in tracker requests
(unless otherwise specified) will be set to the intermediate IP address, if the
user is double NATed. If ther user is not double NATed, this option has no affect.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_connect_boost</span></tt> is the number of peers to try to connect to immediately
when the first tracker response is received for a torrent. This is a boost to
given to new torrents to accelerate them starting up. The normal connect scheduler
is run once every second, this allows peers to be connected immediately instead
of waiting for the session tick to trigger connections.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seeding_outgoing_connections</span></tt> determines if seeding (and finished) torrents
should attempt to make outgoing connections or not. By default this is true. It
may be set to false in very specific applications where the cost of making
outgoing connections is high, and there are no or small benefits of doing so.
For instance, if no nodes are behind a firewall or a NAT, seeds don't need to
make outgoing connections.</p>
<p>if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no_connect_privileged_ports</span></tt> is true (which is the default), libtorrent
will not connect to any peers on priviliged ports (&lt;= 1023). This can mitigate
using bittorrent swarms for certain DDoS attacks.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alert_queue_size</span></tt> is the maximum number of alerts queued up internally. If
alerts are not popped, the queue will eventually fill up to this level. This
defaults to 1000.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_metadata_size</span></tt> is the maximum allowed size (in bytes) to be received
by the metadata extension, i.e. magnet links. It defaults to 1 MiB.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">smooth_connects</span></tt> is true by default, which means the number of connection
attempts per second may be limited to below the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connection_speed</span></tt>, in case
we're close to bump up against the limit of number of connections. The intention
of this setting is to more evenly distribute our connection attempts over time,
instead of attempting to connectin in batches, and timing them out in batches.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">always_send_user_agent</span></tt> defaults to false. When set to true, web connections
will include a user-agent with every request, as opposed to just the first
request in a connection.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apply_ip_filter_to_trackers</span></tt> defaults to true. It determines whether the
IP filter applies to trackers as well as peers. If this is set to false,
trackers are exempt from the IP filter (if there is one). If no IP filter
is set, this setting is irrelevant.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">read_job_every</span></tt> is used to avoid starvation of read jobs in the disk I/O
thread. By default, read jobs are deferred, sorted by physical disk location
and serviced once all write jobs have been issued. In scenarios where the
download rate is enough to saturate the disk, there's a risk the read jobs will
never be serviced. With this setting, every <em>x</em> write job, issued in a row, will
instead pick one read job off of the sorted queue, where <em>x</em> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">read_job_every</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_disk_read_ahead</span></tt> defaults to true and will attempt to optimize disk reads
by giving the operating system heads up of disk read requests as they are queued
in the disk job queue. This gives a significant performance boost for seeding.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock_files</span></tt> determines whether or not to lock files which libtorrent is downloading
to or seeding from. This is implemented using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcntl(F_SETLK)</span></tt> on unix systems and
by not passing in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHARE_READ</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHARE_WRITE</span></tt> on windows. This might prevent
3rd party processes from corrupting the files under libtorrent's feet.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssl_listen</span></tt> sets the listen port for SSL connections. If this is set to 0,
no SSL listen port is opened. Otherwise a socket is opened on this port. This
setting is only taken into account when opening the regular listen port, and
won't re-open the listen socket simply by changing this setting.</p>
<p>It defaults to port 4433.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tracker_backoff</span></tt> determines how aggressively to back off from retrying
failing trackers. This value determines <em>x</em> in the following formula, determining
the number of seconds to wait until the next retry:</p>
<blockquote>
delay = 5 + 5 * x / 100 * fails^2</blockquote>
<p>It defaults to 250.</p>
<p>This setting may be useful to make libtorrent more or less aggressive in hitting
trackers.</p>

<p>This function decodes <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification">bencoded</a> data.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lazy_bdecode()</span></tt> should be preferred over <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bdecode()</span></tt>.
It is more efficient and more secure. It supports having constraints on the
amount of memory is consumed by the parser.</p>
<p><em>lazy</em> refers to the fact that it doesn't copy any actual data out of the
bencoded buffer. It builds a tree of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lazy_entry</span></tt> which has pointers into
the bencoded buffer. This makes it very fast and efficient. On top of that,
it is not recursive, which saves a lot of stack space when parsing deeply
nested trees. However, in order to protect against potential attacks, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">depth_limit</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">item_limit</span></tt> control how many levels deep the tree is
allowed to get. With recursive parser, a few thousand levels would be enough
to exhaust the threads stack and terminate the process. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">item_limit</span></tt>
protects against very large structures, not necessarily deep. Each bencoded
item in the structure causes the parser to allocate some amount of memory,
this memory is constant regardless of how much data actually is stored in
the item. One potential attack is to create a bencoded list of hundreds of
thousands empty strings, which would cause the parser to allocate a significant
amount of memory, perhaps more than is available on the machine, and effectively
provide a denial of service. The default item limit is set as a reasonable
upper limit for desktop computers. Very few torrents have more items in them.
The limit corresponds to about 25 MB, which might be a bit much for embedded
systems.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">start</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">end</span></tt> defines the bencoded buffer to be decoded. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ret</span></tt> is
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lazy_entry</span></tt> which is filled in with the whole decoded tree. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ec</span></tt>
is a reference to an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_code</span></tt> which is set to describe the error encountered
in case the function fails. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_pos</span></tt> is an optional pointer to an int,

in case the function fails.</p>

<p>If possible, <a class="reference internal" href="#lazy-bdecode">lazy_bdecode()</a> should be preferred over <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bdecode()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#entry">entry</a> class is the internal representation of the bencoded data
and it can be used to retrieve information, an <a class="reference internal" href="#entry">entry</a> can also be build by
the program and given to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bencode()</span></tt> to encode it into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OutIt</span></tt>
iterator.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OutIt</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">InIt</span></tt> are iterators
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html">InputIterator</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/OutputIterator.html">OutputIterator</a> respectively). They

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/back_insert_iterator.html">back_insert_iterator</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/istream_iterator.html">istream_iterator</a>. These
functions will assume that the iterator refers to a character
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char</span></tt>). So, if you want to encode entry <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></tt> into a buffer
in memory, you can do it like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
std::vector&lt;char&gt; buffer;
bencode(std::back_inserter(buf), e);
</pre>
<p>If you want to decode a torrent file from a buffer in memory, you can do it like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
std::vector&lt;char&gt; buffer;
// ...
entry e = bdecode(buf.begin(), buf.end());
</pre>
<p>Or, if you have a raw char buffer:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
const char* buf;
// ...
entry e = bdecode(buf, buf + data_size);
</pre>
<p>Now we just need to know how to retrieve information from the <a class="reference internal" href="#entry">entry</a>.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bdecode()</span></tt> encounters invalid encoded data in the range given to it
it will throw <a class="reference internal" href="#libtorrent-exception">libtorrent_exception</a>.</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt> returns an integer that is unique to this alert type. It can be
compared against a specific alert by querying a static constant called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alert_type</span></tt>
in the alert. It can be used to determine the run-time type of an alert* in
order to cast to that alert type and access specific members.</p>
<p>e.g:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
std::auto_ptr&lt;alert&gt; a = ses.pop_alert();
switch (a-&gt;type())
{
        case read_piece_alert::alert_type:

</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">what()</span></tt> returns a string literal describing the type of the alert. It does
not include any information that might be bundled with the alert.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category()</span></tt> returns a bitmask specifying which categories this alert belong to.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clone()</span></tt> returns a pointer to a copy of the alert.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">discardable()</span></tt> determines whether or not an alert is allowed to be discarded
when the alert queue is full. There are a few alerts which may not be discared,
since they would break the user contract, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_resume_data_alert</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">message()</span></tt> generate a string describing the alert and the information bundled
with it. This is mainly intended for debug and development use. It is not suitable
to use this for applications that may be localized. Instead, handle each alert
type individually and extract and render the information from the alert depending
on the locale.</p>
<p>There's another alert base class that most alerts derives from, all the
alerts that are generated for a specific torrent are derived from:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct torrent_alert: alert

        // ...
        torrent_handle handle;

</pre>
<p>There's also a base class for all alerts referring to tracker events:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

        // ...
        std::string url;

<h2>torrent_added_alert</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_added_alert</span></tt> is posted once every time a torrent is added.
It doesn't contain any members of its own, but inherits the torrent handle
from its base class.
It's posted when the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status_notification</span></tt> bit is set in the alert mask.</p>

<div class="section" id="torrent-removed-alert">
<h2>torrent_removed_alert</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">torrent_removed_alert</span></tt> is posted whenever a torrent is removed. Since
the torrent handle in its baseclass will always be invalid (since the torrent

<div class="section" id="listen-failed-alert">
<h2>listen_failed_alert</h2>
<p>This alert is generated when none of the ports, given in the port range, to

<p>libtorrent may sometimes try to listen on port 0, if all other ports failed.
Port 0 asks the operating system to pick a port that's free). If that fails

<dt>outstanding_disk_buffer_limit_reached</dt>
<dd>This warning means that the number of bytes queued to be written to disk
exceeds the max disk byte queue setting (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::max_queued_disk_bytes</span></tt>).
This might restrict the download rate, by not queuing up enough write jobs
to the disk I/O thread. When this alert is posted, peer connections are
temporarily stopped from downloading, until the queued disk bytes have fallen
below the limit again. Unless your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_queued_disk_bytes</span></tt> setting is already
high, you might want to increase it to get better performance.</dd>
<dt>outstanding_request_limit_reached</dt>
<dd>This is posted when libtorrent would like to send more requests to a peer,
but it's limited by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::max_out_request_queue</span></tt>. The queue length
libtorrent is trying to achieve is determined by the download rate and the
assumed round-trip-time (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::request_queue_time</span></tt>). The assumed
rount-trip-time is not limited to just the network RTT, but also the remote disk
access time and message handling time. It defaults to 3 seconds. The target number
of outstanding requests is set to fill the bandwidth-delay product (assumed RTT
times download rate divided by number of bytes per request). When this alert
is posted, there is a risk that the number of outstanding requests is too low
and limits the download rate. You might want to increase the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_out_request_queue</span></tt>
setting.</dd>
<dt>upload_limit_too_low</dt>
<dd>This warning is posted when the amount of TCP/IP overhead is greater than the
upload rate limit. When this happens, the TCP/IP overhead is caused by a much
faster download rate, triggering TCP ACK packets. These packets eat into the
rate limit specified to libtorrent. When the overhead traffic is greater than
the rate limit, libtorrent will not be able to send any actual payload, such
as piece requests. This means the download rate will suffer, and new requests
can be sent again. There will be an equilibrium where the download rate, on
average, is about 20 times the upload rate limit. If you want to maximize the
download rate, increase the upload rate limit above 5% of your download capacity.</dd>
<dt>download_limit_too_low</dt>
<dd>This is the same warning as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload_limit_too_low</span></tt> but referring to the download
limit instead of upload. This suggests that your download rate limit is mcuh lower
than your upload capacity. Your upload rate will suffer. To maximize upload rate,
make sure your download rate limit is above 5% of your upload capacity.</dd>
<dt>send_buffer_watermark_too_low</dt>
<dd><p class="first">We're stalled on the disk. We want to write to the socket, and we can write
but our send buffer is empty, waiting to be refilled from the disk.
This either means the disk is slower than the network connection
or that our send buffer watermark is too small, because we can
send it all before the disk gets back to us.
The number of bytes that we keep outstanding, requested from the disk, is calculated
as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
min(512, max(upload_rate * send_buffer_watermark_factor / 100, send_buffer_watermark))

<dt>too_many_optimistic_unchoke_slots</dt>
<dd>If the half (or more) of all upload slots are set as optimistic unchoke slots, this
warning is issued. You probably want more regular (rate based) unchoke slots.</dd>
<dt>too_high_disk_queue_limit</dt>
<dd>If the disk write queue ever grows larger than half of the cache size, this warning
is posted. The disk write queue eats into the total disk cache and leaves very little
left for the actual cache. This causes the disk cache to oscillate in evicting large
portions of the cache before allowing peers to download any more, onto the disk write
queue. Either lower <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_queued_disk_bytes</span></tt> or increase <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cache_size</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>too_few_outgoing_ports</dt>
<dd>This is generated if outgoing peer connections are failing because of <em>address in use</em>
errors, indicating that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::outgoing_ports</span></tt> is set and is too small of

<h2>translating error codes</h2>
<p>The error_code::message() function will typically return a localized error string,
for system errors. That is, errors that belong to the generic or system category.</p>
<p>Errors that belong to the libtorrent error category are not localized however, they
are only available in english. In order to translate libtorrent errors, compare the
error category of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_code</span></tt> object against <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libtorrent::get_libtorrent_category()</span></tt>,
and if matches, you know the error code refers to the list above. You can provide
your own mapping from error code to string, which is localized. In this case, you
cannot rely on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_code::message()</span></tt> to generate your strings.</p>
<p>The numeric values of the errors are part of the API and will stay the same, although
new error codes may be appended at the end.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of how to translate error codes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
std::string error_code_to_string(boost::system::error_code const&amp; ec)
{
        if (ec.category() != libtorrent::get_libtorrent_category())
        {
                return ec.message();
        }
        // the error is a libtorrent error

        int code = ec.value();
        static const char const* swedish[] =
        {
                &quot;inget fel&quot;,
                &quot;en fil i torrenten kolliderar med en fil från en annan torrent&quot;,
                &quot;hash check misslyckades&quot;,
                &quot;torrent filen är inte en dictionary&quot;,
                &quot;'info'-nyckeln saknas eller är korrupt i torrentfilen&quot;,

                &quot;'piece length' fältet saknas eller är korrupt i torrentfilen&quot;,
                &quot;torrentfilen saknar namnfältet&quot;,
                &quot;ogiltigt namn i torrentfilen (kan vara en attack)&quot;,
                // ... more strings here
        };

        // use the default error string in case we don't have it
        // in our translated list
        if (code &lt; 0 || code &gt;= sizeof(swedish)/sizeof(swedish[0]))

<div class="section" id="storage-interface">
<h1>storage_interface</h1>
<p>The storage interface is a pure virtual class that can be implemented to
customize how and where data for a torrent is stored. The default storage
implementation uses regular files in the filesystem, mapping the files in the
torrent in the way one would assume a torrent is saved to disk. Implementing
your own storage interface makes it possible to store all data in RAM, or in
some optimized order on disk (the order the pieces are received for instance),
or saving multifile torrents in a single file in order to be able to take
advantage of optimized disk-I/O.</p>
<p>It is also possible to write a thin class that uses the default storage but
modifies some particular behavior, for instance encrypting the data before
it's written to disk, and decrypting it when it's read again.</p>
<p>The storage interface is based on slots, each slot is 'piece_size' number
of bytes. All access is done by writing and reading whole or partial
slots. One slot is one piece in the torrent, but the data in the slot
does not necessarily correspond to the piece with the same index (in
compact allocation mode it won't).</p>
<p>libtorrent comes with two built-in storage implementations; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default_storage</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disabled_storage</span></tt>. Their constructor functions are called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default_storage_constructor</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disabled_storage_constructor</span></tt> respectively. The disabled storage does
just what it sounds like. It throws away data that's written, and it
reads garbage. It's useful mostly for benchmarking and profiling purpose.</p>
<p>The interface looks like this:</p>

<p>The format of the magnet URI is:</p>

<h1>queuing</h1>
<p>libtorrent supports <em>queuing</em>. Which means it makes sure that a limited number of
torrents are being downloaded at any given time, and once a torrent is completely
downloaded, the next in line is started.</p>
<p>Torrents that are <em>auto managed</em> are subject to the queuing and the active torrents
limits. To make a torrent auto managed, set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_managed</span></tt> to true when adding the
torrent (see <a class="reference internal" href="#async-add-torrent-add-torrent">async_add_torrent() add_torrent()</a>).</p>
<p>The limits of the number of downloading and seeding torrents are controlled via
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_seeds</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_limit</span></tt> in <a class="reference internal" href="#session-settings">session_settings</a>.
These limits takes non auto managed torrents into account as well. If there are
more non-auto managed torrents being downloaded than the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active_downloads</span></tt>
setting, any auto managed torrents will be queued until torrents are removed so
that the number drops below the limit.</p>
<p>The default values are 8 active downloads and 5 active seeds.</p>
<p>At a regular interval, torrents are checked if there needs to be any re-ordering of
which torrents are active and which are queued. This interval can be controlled via
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto_manage_interval</span></tt> in <a class="reference internal" href="#session-settings">session_settings</a>. It defaults to every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>For queuing to work, resume data needs to be saved and restored for all torrents.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#save-resume-data">save_resume_data()</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="downloading">
<h2>downloading</h2>
<p>Torrents that are currently being downloaded or incomplete (with bytes still to download)
are queued. The torrents in the front of the queue are started to be actively downloaded
and the rest are ordered with regards to their queue position. Any newly added torrent
is placed at the end of the queue. Once a torrent is removed or turns into a seed, its
queue position is -1 and all torrents that used to be after it in the queue, decreases their
position in order to fill the gap.</p>
<p>The queue positions are always in a sequence without any gaps.</p>
<p>Lower queue position means closer to the front of the queue, and will be started sooner than
torrents with higher queue positions.</p>
<p>To query a torrent for its position in the queue, or change its position, see:

<div class="section" id="seeding">
<h2>seeding</h2>
<p>Auto managed seeding torrents are rotated, so that all of them are allocated a fair

<h1>fast resume</h1>
<p>The fast resume mechanism is a way to remember which pieces are downloaded
and where they are put between sessions. You can generate fast resume data by
calling <a class="reference internal" href="#save-resume-data">save_resume_data()</a> on <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-handle">torrent_handle</a>. You can
then save this data to disk and use it when resuming the torrent. libtorrent
will not check the piece hashes then, and rely on the information given in the
fast-resume data. The fast-resume data also contains information about which
blocks, in the unfinished pieces, were downloaded, so it will not have to
start from scratch on the partially downloaded pieces.</p>
<p>To use the fast-resume data you simply give it to <a class="reference internal" href="#async-add-torrent-add-torrent">async_add_torrent() add_torrent()</a>, and it
will skip the time consuming checks. It may have to do the checking anyway, if
the fast-resume data is corrupt or doesn't fit the storage for that torrent,
then it will not trust the fast-resume data and just do the checking.</p>

<div class="section" id="storage-allocation">
<h1>storage allocation</h1>
<p>There are two modes in which storage (files on disk) are allocated in libtorrent.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The traditional <em>full allocation</em> mode, where the entire files are filled up with
zeros before anything is downloaded. libtorrent will look for sparse files support
in the filesystem that is used for storage, and use sparse files or file system
zero fill support if present. This means that on NTFS, full allocation mode will
only allocate storage for the downloaded pieces.</li>
<li>The <em>sparse allocation</em>, sparse files are used, and pieces are downloaded directly
to where they belong. This is the recommended (and default) mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>In previous versions of libtorrent, a 3rd mode was supported, <em>compact allocation</em>.
Support for this is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of libtorrent.
It's still described in here for completeness.</p>
<p>The allocation mode is selected when a torrent is started. It is passed as an
argument to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session::add_torrent()</span></tt> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#async-add-torrent-add-torrent">async_add_torrent() add_torrent()</a>).</p>
<p>The decision to use full allocation or compact allocation typically depends on whether
any files have priority 0 and if the filesystem supports sparse files.</p>
<div class="section" id="sparse-allocation">
<h2>sparse allocation</h2>
<p>On filesystems that supports sparse files, this allocation mode will only use
as much space as has been downloaded.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It does not require an allocation pass on startup.</li>
<li>It supports skipping files (setting prioirty to 0 to not download).</li>
<li>Fast resume data will remain valid even when file time stamps are out of date.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="full-allocation">
<h2>full allocation</h2>
<p>When a torrent is started in full allocation mode, the disk-io thread
will make sure that the entire storage is allocated, and fill any gaps with zeros.
This will be skipped if the filesystem supports sparse files or automatic zero filling.
It will of course still check for existing pieces and fast resume data. The main
drawbacks of this mode are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It may take longer to start the torrent, since it will need to fill the files
with zeros on some systems. This delay is linearly dependent on the size of
the download.</li>
<li>The download may occupy unnecessary disk space between download sessions. In case
sparse files are not supported.</li>
<li>Disk caches usually perform extremely poorly with random access to large files
and may slow down a download considerably.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The benefits of this mode are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Downloaded pieces are written directly to their final place in the files and the
total number of disk operations will be fewer and may also play nicer to
filesystems' file allocation, and reduce fragmentation.</li>
<li>No risk of a download failing because of a full disk during download. Unless
sparse files are being used.</li>
<li>The fast resume data will be more likely to be usable, regardless of crashes or
out of date data, since pieces won't move around.</li>
<li>Can be used with prioritizing files to 0.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compact-allocation">
<h2>compact allocation</h2>
<p>Note that support for compact allocation is deprecated in libttorrent, and will
be removed in future versions.</p>
<p>The compact allocation will only allocate as much storage as it needs to keep the
pieces downloaded so far. This means that pieces will be moved around to be placed
at their final position in the files while downloading (to make sure the completed
download has all its pieces in the correct place). So, the main drawbacks are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More disk operations while downloading since pieces are moved around.</li>
<li>Potentially more fragmentation in the filesystem.</li>
<li>Cannot be used while having files with priority 0.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The benefits though, are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No startup delay, since the files don't need allocating.</li>
<li>The download will not use unnecessary disk space.</li>
<li>Disk caches perform much better than in full allocation and raises the download
speed limit imposed by the disk.</li>
<li>Works well on filesystems that don't support sparse files.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithm that is used when allocating pieces and slots isn't very complicated.
For the interested, a description follows.</p>
<p>storing a piece:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>let <strong>A</strong> be a newly downloaded piece, with index <strong>n</strong>.</li>
<li>let <strong>s</strong> be the number of slots allocated in the file we're
downloading to. (the number of pieces it has room for).</li>
<li>if <strong>n</strong> &gt;= <strong>s</strong> then allocate a new slot and put the piece there.</li>
<li>if <strong>n</strong> &lt; <strong>s</strong> then allocate a new slot, move the data at
slot <strong>n</strong> to the new slot and put <strong>A</strong> in slot <strong>n</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>allocating a new slot:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>if there's an unassigned slot (a slot that doesn't
contain any piece), return that slot index.</li>
<li>append the new slot at the end of the file (or find an unused slot).</li>
<li>let <strong>i</strong> be the index of newly allocated slot</li>
<li>if we have downloaded piece index <strong>i</strong> already (to slot <strong>j</strong>) then<ol class="arabic">
<li>move the data at slot <strong>j</strong> to slot <strong>i</strong>.</li>
<li>return slot index <strong>j</strong> as the newly allocated free slot.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>return <strong>i</strong> as the newly allocated slot.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="http-seeding">
<h2>HTTP seeding</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of HTTP seeding. One with that assumes a smart
(and polite) client and one that assumes a smart server. These
are specified in <a class="reference external" href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html">BEP 19</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html">BEP 17</a> respectively.</p>
<p>libtorrent supports both. In the libtorrent source code and API,
BEP 19 urls are typically referred to as <em>url seeds</em> and BEP 17
urls are typically referred to as <em>HTTP seeds</em>.</p>
<p>The libtorrent implementation of <a class="reference external" href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html">BEP 19</a> assumes that, if the URL ends with a slash
('/'), the filename should be appended to it in order to request pieces from
that file. The way this works is that if the torrent is a single-file torrent,
only that filename is appended. If the torrent is a multi-file torrent, the
torrent's name '/' the file name is appended. This is the same directory
structure that libtorrent will download torrents into.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="piece-picker">
<h1>piece picker</h1>
<p>The piece picker in libtorrent has the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>rarest first</li>
<li>sequential download</li>
<li>random pick</li>
<li>reverse order picking</li>
<li>parole mode</li>
<li>prioritize partial pieces</li>
<li>prefer whole pieces</li>
<li>piece affinity by speed category</li>
<li>piece priorities</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="internal-representation">
<h2>internal representation</h2>
<p>It is optimized by, at all times, keeping a list of pieces ordered
by rarity, randomly shuffled within each rarity class. This list
is organized as a single vector of contigous memory in RAM, for
optimal memory locality and to eliminate heap allocations and frees
when updating rarity of pieces.</p>
<p>Expensive events, like a peer joining or leaving, are evaluated
lazily, since it's cheaper to rebuild the whole list rather than
updating every single piece in it. This means as long as no blocks
are picked, peers joining and leaving is no more costly than a single
peer joining or leaving. Of course the special cases of peers that have
all or no pieces are optimized to not require rebuilding the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="picker-strategy">
<h2>picker strategy</h2>
<p>The normal mode of the picker is of course <em>rarest first</em>, meaning
pieces that few peers have are preferred to be downloaded over pieces
that more peers have. This is a fundamental algorithm that is the
basis of the performance of bittorrent. However, the user may set the
piece picker into sequential download mode. This mode simply picks
pieces sequentially, always preferring lower piece indices.</p>
<p>When a torrent starts out, picking the rarest pieces means increased
risk that pieces won't be completed early (since there are only a few
peers they can be downloaded from), leading to a delay of having any
piece to offer to other peers. This lack of pieces to trade, delays
the client from getting started into the normal tit-for-tat mode of
bittorrent, and will result in a long ramp-up time. The heuristic to
mitigate this problem is to, for the first few pieces, pick random pieces
rather than rare pieces. The threshold for when to leave this initial
picker mode is determined by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::initial_picker_threshold</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reverse-order">
<h2>reverse order</h2>
<p>An orthogonal setting is <em>reverse order</em>, which is used for <em>snubbed</em>
peers. Snubbed peers are peers that appear very slow, and might have timed
out a piece request. The idea behind this is to make all snubbed peers
more likely to be able to do download blocks from the same piece,
concentrating slow peers on as few pieces as possible. The reverse order
means that the most common pieces are picked, instead of the rarest pieces
(or in the case of sequential download, the last pieces, intead of the first).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parole-mode">
<h2>parole mode</h2>
<p>Peers that have participated in a piece that failed the hash check, may be
put in <em>parole mode</em>. This means we prefer downloading a full piece  from this
peer, in order to distinguish which peer is sending corrupt data. Whether to
do this is or not is controlled by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::use_parole_mode</span></tt>.</p>
<p>In parole mode, the piece picker prefers picking one whole piece at a time for
a given peer, avoiding picking any blocks from a piece any other peer has
contributed to (since that would defeat the purpose of parole mode).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prioritize-partial-pieces">
<h2>prioritize partial pieces</h2>
<p>This setting determines if partially downloaded or requested pieces should always
be preferred over other pieces. The benefit of doing this is that the number of
partial pieces is minimized (and hence the turn-around time for downloading a block
until it can be uploaded to others is minimized). It also puts less stress on the
disk cache, since fewer partial pieces need to be kept in the cache. Whether or
not to enable this is controlled by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::prioritize_partial_pieces</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The main benefit of not prioritizing partial pieces is that the rarest first
algorithm gets to have more influence on which pieces are picked. The picker is
more likely to truly pick the rarest piece, and hence improving the performance
of the swarm.</p>
<p>This setting is turned on automatically whenever the number of partial pieces
in the piece picker exceeds the number of peers we're connected to times 1.5.
This is in order to keep the waste of partial pieces to a minimum, but still
prefer rarest pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prefer-whole-pieces">
<h2>prefer whole pieces</h2>
<p>The <em>prefer whole pieces</em> setting makes the piece picker prefer picking entire
pieces at a time. This is used by web connections (both http seeding
standards), in order to be able to coalesce the small bittorrent requests
to larger HTTP requests. This significantly improves performance when
downloading over HTTP.</p>
<p>It is also used by peers that are downloading faster than a certain
threshold. The main advantage is that these peers will better utilize the
other peer's disk cache, by requesting all blocks in a single piece, from
the same peer.</p>
<p>This threshold is controlled by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::whole_pieces_threshold</span></tt>.</p>

<h1>SSL torrents</h1>
<p>Torrents may have an SSL root (CA) certificate embedded in them. Such torrents
are called <em>SSL torrents</em>. An SSL torrent talks to all bittorrent peers over SSL.
The protocols are layered like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+-----------------------+
| BitTorrent protocol   |
+-----------------------+
| SSL                   |
+-----------+-----------+
| TCP       | uTP       |
|           +-----------+
|           | UDP       |
+-----------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>During the SSL handshake, both peers need to authenticate by providing a certificate
that is signed by the CA certificate found in the .torrent file. These peer
certificates are expected to be privided to peers through some other means than
bittorrent. Typically by a peer generating a certificate request which is sent to
the publisher of the torrent, and the publisher returning a signed certificate.</p>
<p>In libtorrent, <a class="reference internal" href="#set-ssl-certificate">set_ssl_certificate()</a> in <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-handle">torrent_handle</a> is used to tell libtorrent where
to find the peer certificate and the private key for it. When an SSL torrent is loaded,
the <a class="reference internal" href="#torrent-need-cert-alert">torrent_need_cert_alert</a> is posted to remind the user to provide a certificate.</p>
<p>A peer connecting to an SSL torrent MUST provide the <em>SNI</em> TLS extension (server name
indication). The server name is the hex encoded info-hash of the torrent to connect to.
This is required for the client accepting the connection to know which certificate to
present.</p>
<p>SSL connections are accepted on a separate socket from normal bittorrent connections. To
pick which port the SSL socket should bind to, set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">session_settings::ssl_listen</span></tt> to a
different port. It defaults to port 4433. This setting is only taken into account when the
normal listen socket is opened (i.e. just changing this setting won't necessarily close
and re-open the SSL socket). To not listen on an SSL socket at all, set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssl_listen</span></tt> to 0.</p>
<p>This feature is only available if libtorrent is build with openssl support (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TORRENT_USE_OPENSSL</span></tt>)
and requires at least openSSL version 1.0, since it needs SNI support.</p>
<p>Peer certificates must have at least one <em>SubjectAltName</em> field of type dNSName. At least
one of the fields must <em>exactly</em> match the name of the torrent. This is a byte-by-byte comparison,
the UTF-8 encoding must be identical (i.e. there's no unicode normalization going on). This is
the recommended way of verifying certificates for HTTPS servers according to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt">RFC 2818</a>. Note
the difference that for torrents only <em>dNSName</em> fields are taken into account (not IP address fields).
The most specific (i.e. last) <em>Common Name</em> field is also taken into account if no <em>SubjectAltName</em>
did not match.</p>
<p>If any of these fields contain a single asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), the certificate is considered covering
any torrent, allowing it to be reused for any torrent.</p>
<p>The purpose of matching the torrent name with the fields in the peer certificate is to allow
a publisher to have a single root certificate for all torrents it distributes, and issue
separate peer certificates for each torrent. A peer receiving a certificate will not necessarily
be able to access all torrents published by this root certificate (only if it has a &quot;star cert&quot;).</p>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h2>testing</h2>
<p>To test incoming SSL connections to an SSL torrent, one can use the following <em>openssl</em> command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
openssl s_client -cert &lt;peer-certificate&gt;.pem -key &lt;peer-private-key&gt;.pem -CAfile &lt;torrent-cert&gt;.pem -debug -connect 127.0.0.1:4433 -tls1 -servername &lt;info-hash&gt;
</pre>
<p>To create a root certificate, the Distinguished Name (<em>DN</em>) is not taken into account
by bittorrent peers. You still need to specify something, but from libtorrent's point of
view, it doesn't matter what it is. libtorrent only makes sure the peer certificates are
signed by the correct root certificate.</p>
<p>One way to create the certificates is to use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CA.sh</span></tt> script that comes with openssl, like thisi (don't forget to enter a common Name for the certificate):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
CA.sh -newca
CA.sh -newreq
CA.sh -sign
</pre>
<p>The torrent certificate is located in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./demoCA/private/demoCA/cacert.pem</span></tt>, this is
the pem file to include in the .torrent file.</p>
<p>The peer's certificate is located in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./newcert.pem</span></tt> and the certificate's
private key in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./newkey.pem</span></tt>.</p>
