	  zero-sized files.
	* added support for trackerless torrents (with kademlia DHT).
	* support for torrents with the private flag set.
	* support for torrents containing bootstrap nodes for the
	  DHT network.
	* fixed problem with the configure script on FreeBSD.
	* limits the pipelining used on url-seeds.
	* fixed problem where the shutdown always would delay for
	  session_settings::stop_tracker_timeout seconds.

	  interface is the same as the one currently in use.
	* added http proxy support for web seeds.
	* fixed problem where upload and download stats could become incorrect
	  in case of high cpu load.
	* added more clients to the identifiable list.

	* fixed a bug in storage that would, in rare cases, fail to do a
	  complete check.

	* improved the piece picker performance and made it possible to download
	  popular pieces in sequence to improve disk performance.

	* fixed problem with re-requesting skipped pieces when peer was sending pieces
	  out of fifo-order.

	  able to download from http-sources.

	  dealing with network addresses).

	* added a new alert, metadata_failed_alert
	* changed the interface to session::add_torrent for some speed optimizations.

	* fixed bug where upload rate limit was not being applied.
	* files that are being checked will no longer stall files that don't need
	  checking.
	* changed the way libtorrent identifies support for its excentions
	  to look for 'ext' at the end of the peer-id.
	* improved performance by adding a circle buffer for the send buffer.
	* fixed bugs in the http tracker connection when using an http proxy.
	* fixed problem with storage's file pool when creating torrents and then
	  starting to seed them.
	* hard limit on remote request queue and timeout on requests (a timeout
	  triggers rerequests). This makes libtorrent work much better with
	  "broken" clients like BitComet which may ignore requests.
