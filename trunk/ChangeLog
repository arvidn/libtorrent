	  local codepage on windows

	* client_test can now monitor a directory for torrent files and automatically
	  start and stop downloads while running
	* fixed problem with file_size() when building on windows with unicode support
	* added a new torrent state, allocating
	* added a new alert, metadata_failed_alert
	* changed the interface to session::add_torrent for some speed optimizations.
	* greatly improved the command line control of the example client_test.
	* fixed bug where upload rate limit was not being applied.
	* files that are being checked will no longer stall files that don't need
	  checking.
	* changed the way libtorrent identifies support for its excentions
	  to look for 'ext' at the end of the peer-id.
	* improved performance by adding a circle buffer for the send buffer.
	* fixed bugs in the http tracker connection when using an http proxy.
	* fixed problem with storage's file pool when creating torrents and then
	  starting to seed them.
