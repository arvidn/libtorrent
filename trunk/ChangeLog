	* changed the way libtorrent identifies support for its excentions
	  to look for 'ext' at the end of the peer-id.
	* improved performance by adding a circle buffer for the send buffer
	* fixed bugs in the http tracker connection when using an http proxy.
	* fixed problem with storage's file pool when creating torrents and then
	  starting to seed them.
	* hard limit on remote request queue and timeout on requests (a timeout
	  triggers rerequests). This makes libtorrent work much better with
	  "broken" clients like BitComet which may ignore requests.
